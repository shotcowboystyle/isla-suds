# Benchmark — Competitive Design Analysis

## Before running

This command needs a product and the competitors to benchmark against.

If the user invoked it with nothing and no target is evident from the conversation or open files, ask for it in one plain-language question and stop. Do not invent a target and do not produce generic output in place of the real work — output about something imaginary reads as authoritative and is worthless.

If a target is evident from context, use it and say which one you picked.

Compare a design against the best apps in its category. Score across 10 dimensions, identify specific gaps, and generate an actionable roadmap to close them.

## Protocol

### Step 1: Establish Context

Determine what is being benchmarked and against what:

- **Subject**: The design, app, or product being evaluated (accept code, screenshots, descriptions, or URLs)
- **Category**: The product category for comparison (e.g., "neobank", "team messaging", "food delivery")
- **Competitors**: If specified by the user, benchmark against those. Otherwise, select the top 5 in the category
- **Platform**: iOS, Android, Web, Desktop, or cross-platform
- **Maturity stage**: Early (MVP/beta), Growth (scaling), Mature (established) -- calibrates expectations

### Step 2: Identify the Benchmark Set

Select 5 best-in-class apps in the category. For each:

- **App name and company**
- **Platform availability**
- **Signature UX strength**: What they are known for
- **Market position**: Why they are a valid benchmark
- **Design reputation**: Awards, notable designers, known for design excellence

Selection criteria: Prioritize apps known for design quality, not just market share. A well-designed smaller app can be a better benchmark than a dominant but poorly-designed market leader.

### Step 3: Score Across 10 Dimensions (1-10)

| Score | Meaning                                              |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2   | Broken -- fails basic expectations                   |
| 3-4   | Below average -- noticeably worse than competitors   |
| 5-6   | Average -- meets baseline, no standout quality       |
| 7-8   | Good -- above average, intentional design thinking   |
| 9-10  | Exceptional -- best-in-class, a reference for others |

**Dimension 1: Visual Polish**

- Consistency of visual language across screens
- Typography quality (hierarchy, spacing, readability)
- Color usage (intentional, accessible, harmonious)
- Iconography and illustration quality
- Attention to detail (alignment, pixel precision, edge cases)

**Dimension 2: Information Architecture**

- Navigation structure clarity and findability
- Content organization and categorization
- Search and discovery effectiveness
- Mental model alignment
- Depth vs. breadth balance

**Dimension 3: Interaction Quality**

- Feedback for every user action (visual, haptic, audio)
- Animation quality and purposefulness
- Gesture support and discoverability
- Touch/click target sizing
- Responsiveness and perceived performance

**Dimension 4: Accessibility**

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation completeness
- Color contrast compliance (WCAG AA minimum)
- Text resizing support
- Motion sensitivity respect (prefers-reduced-motion)
- Touch targets minimum 44x44pt
- Focus management quality

**Dimension 5: Performance UX**

- Perceived loading speed (skeleton screens, optimistic updates)
- Offline behavior and resilience
- Error recovery (network failures, timeouts)
- State preservation (back button, app switching, session restore)
- Progressive loading, startup time

**Dimension 6: Onboarding**

- Time to first value
- Progressive disclosure
- Permission request timing and copy
- Skip-ability
- Return user experience

**Dimension 7: Navigation**

- Primary navigation clarity and reachability
- Wayfinding (user always knows where they are)
- Back/undo/escape reliability
- Deep linking and shareability
- Navigation efficiency (steps to reach any feature)

**Dimension 8: Content Quality**

- Microcopy clarity (labels, instructions, CTAs)
- Error message helpfulness
- Empty state design (instructive, actionable)
- Tone consistency
- Content loading and pagination patterns

**Dimension 9: Mobile Experience**

- Thumb-zone optimization
- Platform convention adherence (iOS HIG / Material 3)
- Gesture utilization (swipe, pinch, long-press)
- System integration (widgets, shortcuts, share sheet, notifications)
- Dynamic Type / text scaling support

**Dimension 10: Innovation**

- Novel interaction patterns solving real problems
- Unique differentiating features
- Creative platform capability use
- Forward-thinking design (AI, spatial, voice)
- Risk-taking that pays off vs. unnecessary novelty

### Step 4: Gap Analysis

For each dimension where the subject scores lower than benchmark leaders:

- **Gap description**: "[Benchmark app] does [specific thing], you don't"
- **Impact**: How much this affects UX (High / Medium / Low)
- **Difficulty to close**: How hard to implement (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- **Quick win available?**: Simple first step that partially closes the gap

### Step 5: Improvement Roadmap

Classify improvements into three tiers:

**Tier 1 -- Quick Wins** (1-2 sprints):

- High impact, low effort
- Visual polish, copy improvements, small interaction fixes
- Ship without major architecture changes

**Tier 2 -- Strategic Improvements** (1-2 quarters):

- Medium-to-high impact, medium effort
- New components, redesigned flows, feature additions
- Closes the most significant gaps

**Tier 3 -- Differentiation Moves** (2-4 quarters):

- Investments that could leapfrog the competition
- Novel features, platform capabilities, design innovations
- Not about closing gaps -- about creating new advantages

### Step 6: Competitive Position Map

Place subject and benchmark apps on a 2x2 matrix:

- Axes selected based on what matters most in the category
- Common pairs: Polish vs. Feature Richness, Simplicity vs. Power, Delight vs. Efficiency
- Identify the open quadrant (opportunity space)

## Quality Gates

The output MUST include:

- [ ] 5 benchmark competitors with selection rationale
- [ ] All 10 dimensions scored with specific evidence for each score
- [ ] Gap analysis with impact and difficulty ratings
- [ ] Three-tier improvement roadmap with actionable items
- [ ] Competitive position map with opportunity space identified
