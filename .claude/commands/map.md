# Map — Information Architecture

## Before running

This command needs a product or body of content to structure.

If the user invoked it with nothing and no target is evident from the conversation or open files, ask for it in one plain-language question and stop. Do not invent a target and do not produce generic output in place of the real work — output about something imaginary reads as authoritative and is worthless.

If a target is evident from context, use it and say which one you picked.

Generate complete information architecture: content inventory, sitemap, navigation model, page-level content hierarchy, cross-linking map, and search strategy. This is the step that separates apps that feel organized from apps that feel like a pile of screens.

## Protocol

### Step 0: Gather Context

Before building IA, collect:

1. **Product description**: What it does, features, content types, core value proposition
2. **User types/roles**: From `/brief` personas if available -- different users may need different navigation paths
3. **Platform**: Web (SPA, MPA, marketing site), mobile (iOS, Android), or both. Platform determines navigation conventions
4. **Scale**: How many pages/screens? A 5-screen mobile app needs a different IA than a 50-page SaaS or a 200-page content site
5. **Prior Design Ops outputs**: Check for `/brief` (personas), `/research` (user mental models, card sorting), `/benchmark` (competitor navigation). Consume if available

If no prior outputs exist, ask directly. Scale is particularly important -- do not build mega-menu IA for a 5-screen app.

### Step 1: Content Inventory

List all content types the product needs.

**Categorize each item**:

- **Primary**: Core to value proposition, used every session (dashboard, main feed, project workspace)
- **Secondary**: Supporting, used regularly but not every session (settings, profile, reports)
- **Tertiary**: Infrequent access (legal pages, help docs, account management, onboarding)

**For each item, note**:

- Content type (page, screen, modal, drawer, panel)
- Expected frequency of access (every visit, weekly, rarely)
- User role(s) that need it
- Whether it contains sub-content (e.g., Settings > Profile, Billing, Notifications)

**Priority ranking**: Stack-rank by user importance, not by what the business wants to promote. Most-accessed content must be most-accessible content.

### Step 2: Sitemap / Screen Map

Generate a hierarchical tree structure.

**For web products** -- page tree with URL structure:

```
/                              Home
├── /dashboard                 Dashboard
├── /projects                  Projects List
│   ├── /projects/:id          Project Detail
│   │   ├── /projects/:id/tasks    Tasks
│   │   └── /projects/:id/settings Project Settings
│   └── /projects/new          Create Project
├── /team                      Team
│   └── /team/:id              Member Profile
├── /settings                  Settings
│   ├── /settings/profile      Profile
│   ├── /settings/billing      Billing
│   └── /settings/notifications Notifications
└── /auth
    ├── /auth/login            Login
    ├── /auth/signup           Signup
    └── /auth/forgot-password  Forgot Password
```

**For mobile products** -- screen hierarchy with navigation depth:

```
Tab Bar
├── [Tab 1] Home
│   └── Detail Screen
├── [Tab 2] Search
│   ├── Results
│   └── Detail Screen
├── [Tab 3] Create (+)
├── [Tab 4] Activity
│   └── Detail Screen
└── [Tab 5] Profile
    └── Settings
        ├── Account
        ├── Notifications
        └── Privacy
```

**Depth rules**:

- Mobile: Maximum 3 levels (deeper = users get lost)
- Web: Maximum 4 levels (deeper = SEO suffers, users abandon)
- If you need more depth, restructure -- don't add levels

**Mark on the sitemap**:

- Primary flows (bold/highlighted)
- Secondary flows (normal)
- Auth-gated sections
- Role-specific sections

### Step 3: Navigation Model

Recommend the navigation system based on product characteristics.

**Primary navigation** (always visible or one gesture away):

| Product Type                | Pattern                              | Examples              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 2-5 sections, mobile        | Tab bar (iOS) / Bottom nav (Android) | Instagram, Spotify    |
| 6-10 sections, web          | Sidebar navigation                   | Notion, Linear, Slack |
| 3-5 sections, web SaaS      | Top navigation bar                   | Stripe, GitHub        |
| 10+ sections, content-heavy | Mega menu or sidebar with groups     | Amazon, Shopify admin |
| 2-3 sections, focused app   | Segmented control or minimal nav     | Calculator, Camera    |

**Secondary navigation**:

- Submenus / dropdown (web)
- Section headers within scrollable views (mobile)
- Breadcrumbs (when depth > 2 levels on web)
- Tab bars within a screen (for sub-sections)

**Utility navigation** (persistent but secondary):

- Search (if >20 items of any type)
- Notifications
- User profile / avatar
- Settings gear
- Help / support

**Breadcrumb strategy**:

- Show on web products with depth > 2 levels
- Format: `Home > Section > Subsection > Current Page`
- Mobile equivalent: back button with section title
- Do NOT use breadcrumbs on flat architectures (wasted space)

### Step 4: Content Hierarchy Per Page

For each key page/screen (top 5-8), define content priority:

**Above the fold** (visible without scrolling):

- What is the #1 thing users need to see/do?
- What is the primary CTA?
- What context/orientation info is needed? (page title, breadcrumb, status)

**Below the fold** (requires scrolling):

- Secondary content in order of importance
- Progressive disclosure: what starts collapsed/hidden?
- Related content / cross-links

**For each screen, specify**:

- Content blocks in priority order (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)
- CTA placement and prominence (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- What can be removed on mobile without losing core value

### Step 5: Cross-Linking Map

Map how pages/screens connect:

**Entry points** -- how users arrive at each page:

- Direct navigation (from nav menu)
- In-context links (from related content)
- Search results
- Notifications
- External links (email, shared URL)

**Exit points** -- where users go from each page:

- Primary action leads to...
- Secondary actions lead to...
- Back/cancel returns to...

**Anti-pattern detection**:

- **Dead ends**: Pages with no forward navigation (trap the user) -- flag these
- **Orphan pages**: Pages not linked from any other page (unreachable) -- flag these
- **Circular flows**: A > B > C > A with no progress -- flag these
- **Forced detours**: Must leave task to complete subtask (breaks flow) -- flag these

### Step 6: Search and Findability

**Does this product need search?**

- Yes if: >20 items of any type, content-heavy, user-generated content, e-commerce
- No if: <10 screens, simple task-focused app, no content to search

**If search is needed**:

- Search scope: global vs. sectional
- Input style: persistent in header vs. expandable vs. dedicated screen
- Results display: list with filters, grouped by type, highlighted matches
- Filters and sort strategy
- Recent searches and suggestions
- Empty state: what to show when no results match

**Findability test**:

- Can users reach any content within 3 clicks/taps?
- Are labels clear and unambiguous? (no jargon, no creative naming)
- Is most-accessed content the most-accessible content?

## Output Format

```
## Information Architecture: [Product Name]

### Content Inventory

| Content | Type | Category | Frequency | Roles | Sub-content |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| [name] | [page/screen/modal] | [primary/secondary/tertiary] | [every visit/weekly/rarely] | [all/specific] | [yes/no] |

### Sitemap
[Tree structure with URLs/screen names]

**Depth analysis**: Max depth = [N] levels. [Assessment]

### Navigation Model

**Primary**: [pattern] -- [why]
**Secondary**: [pattern] -- [when it appears]
**Utility**: [items] -- [placement]
**Breadcrumbs**: [yes/no] -- [format if yes]

### Page Content Hierarchy

#### [Screen 1]
1. [Highest priority content]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
- **Primary CTA**: [action] -- [placement]
- **Progressive disclosure**: [what's hidden until expanded]
- **Mobile adaptation**: [what changes]

[Continue for top 5-8 screens]

### Cross-Linking Map
[Entry/exit points for key screens]

**Anti-patterns detected**:
- Dead ends: [list or "None"]
- Orphan pages: [list or "None"]
- Circular flows: [list or "None"]

### Search & Findability

**Search needed**: [yes/no -- why]
[If yes: scope, input, results, filters, empty state]
**3-click test**: [pass/fail -- which content takes more?]

### Next Steps
1. `/wireframe` -- Create layouts based on this IA
2. `/screen` -- Build production screens
3. `/nav` -- Design the navigation system in detail
```

## Quality Gates

The output MUST include:

- [ ] Content inventory with priority ranking (primary/secondary/tertiary)
- [ ] Sitemap with maximum 3 levels (mobile) or 4 levels (web)
- [ ] Navigation model with platform-appropriate pattern and justification
- [ ] Content hierarchy for at least top 5 screens
- [ ] No dead ends or orphan pages (or flagged if found)
- [ ] Search strategy if product has >20 pages/items
- [ ] 3-click test assessment

The output MUST NOT include:

- Navigation patterns violating platform conventions (e.g., hamburger as primary nav on iOS)
- Sitemaps deeper than 4 levels without restructuring recommendation
- Jargon or ambiguous labels in the sitemap (must be user-facing language)

## Cross-References

- `screen-flow-patterns` skill -- screen types and flow patterns catalog
- `ui-pattern-intelligence` skill -- navigation, search, list/grid patterns
- `navigation-pattern-encyclopedia` skill -- every nav pattern with IA guide
- `cognitive-psychology-ux` skill -- Hick's Law, Miller's Law, serial position effect
- `mobile-ux-design` skill -- mobile navigation conventions (tab bar, nav drawer, bottom sheet)
- `desktop-app-design` skill -- desktop navigation (sidebar, top nav, command palette)
- `accessibility-inclusive-design` skill -- skip links, landmark regions, focus order
- `ux-research-methods` skill -- card sorting and tree testing for IA validation

## Next Step

**Next** --> `/wireframe` -- Create low-fidelity wireframes based on this IA
