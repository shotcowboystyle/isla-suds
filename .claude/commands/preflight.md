# Preflight — Launch Readiness & Post-Launch Plan

## Before running

This command needs a product or release to check.

If the user invoked it with nothing and no target is evident from the conversation or open files, ask for it in one plain-language question and stop. Do not invent a target and do not produce generic output in place of the real work — output about something imaginary reads as authoritative and is worthless.

If a target is evident from context, use it and say which one you picked.

The final gate between "the design is good" and "it's actually ready to ship." This command generates a comprehensive pre-launch checklist AND a post-launch monitoring and iteration plan. Launch is the middle of the product lifecycle, not the end.

## Part 1: Pre-Launch Checklist

### Step 0: Gather Context

1. **Product type**: Web app, mobile app, marketing site, SaaS, e-commerce, hybrid
2. **Platform**: Web, iOS, Android, cross-platform
3. **Target markets**: Geographic regions (affects legal: GDPR for EU, CCPA for California)
4. **Feature flags**: AI features? Payments? User accounts? User-generated content? Each activates additional items
5. **Prior Design Ops outputs**: Consume `/audit`, `/grade`, `/qa`, `/a11y` if available

## Part 2: Post-Launch Plan

### Monitoring Dashboard

**Real-time** (always visible):

- Active users, error rate, page load time, uptime, critical conversions

**Daily review**:

- DAU, session duration, bounce rate, conversion rate, error count by type, support tickets

**Weekly review**:

- WAU, DAU/WAU stickiness, Day 1/7 retention, feature adoption, NPS/CSAT, top 5 user paths

**Monthly review**:

- MAU, growth trend, Day 30 retention, revenue metrics (ARPU, LTV, churn), competitive landscape

**Alert thresholds**:

| Metric          | Warning   | Critical | Action                  |
| --------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| Error rate      | >0.5%     | >1%      | Investigate immediately |
| Page load (p95) | >2s       | >3s      | Performance review      |
| Conversion rate | -5%       | -10%     | Funnel analysis         |
| Availability    | <99.9%    | <99.5%   | Incident response       |
| Support tickets | >1.5x avg | >2x avg  | UX review               |

### Review Cadence

**Week 1 (Launch Week)** -- Daily:

- Focus: Is anything broken? Is anything confusing?
- Monitor: Error rates, support tickets, social mentions, app store reviews
- Actions: Emergency fixes only. Do not redesign -- stabilize.
- Meeting: 15-minute daily standup with eng + design

**Weeks 2-4** -- Weekly:

- Focus: What patterns are emerging in real usage?
- Monitor: Retention curves, feature adoption, user feedback themes
- Actions: Quick wins (<1 day effort). Categorize larger issues.
- Meeting: 30-minute weekly review

**Month 2-3** -- Bi-Weekly:

- Focus: Retention trends, deeper usability insights, first iteration cycle
- Monitor: Cohort retention, NPS trends, competitive moves
- Actions: Plan and ship first iteration. Schedule user interviews.
- Meeting: 45-minute bi-weekly product review

**Month 3+** -- Monthly:

- Focus: Strategic metrics, product-market fit, roadmap
- Monitor: Growth rate, LTV, market position
- Actions: Roadmap adjustments, major feature planning
- Meeting: 60-minute monthly strategy review

### Feedback Channels

**In-app feedback**:

- Micro-surveys: NPS at Day 7 and Day 30
- Contextual feedback: thumbs up/down on key screens
- Feedback button: persistent "Send Feedback" option
- Feature-specific: short survey after first use of new features

**Support analysis**:

- Categorize every ticket: UX issue / Bug / Feature request / Docs gap
- Weekly summary: top 5 UX issues from support data
- Escalation: UX issues with >5 tickets become investigation items

**User interviews**:

- 5 interviews in first 2 weeks post-launch
- Mix: 2 successful users, 2 struggling users, 1 churned user
- Focus: What was confusing? What was delightful? What was expected but missing?

**Behavioral analytics**:

- Rage click detection
- Dead click detection
- Drop-off analysis on multi-step flows
- Session replay review (10 sessions/week)

**Social listening**:

- Product mentions on Twitter/X, Reddit, Product Hunt, Hacker News
- App store reviews and ratings
- Community forums or Discord
- Competitor mention tracking

### Iteration Priority Framework

| Priority | Definition                                                             | Timeline     |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **P0**   | Blocks primary flow, accessibility failure, security issue, data loss  | Fix same day |
| **P1**   | High-impact UX issue (>10% users), conversion blocker, 3+ user reports | This sprint  |
| **P2**   | Medium-impact improvement, multiple user requests, missing states      | Next sprint  |
| **P3**   | Nice-to-have, edge cases, design debt, A/B test candidates             | Backlog      |

**Decision matrix**:

|                   | Quick (<1 day)     | Medium (1-3 days) | Large (3+ days)       |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| **High Impact**   | Do immediately     | This sprint       | Plan for next sprint  |
| **Medium Impact** | This sprint        | Evaluate ROI      | Backlog with priority |
| **Low Impact**    | Batch with similar | Backlog           | Deprioritize          |

### Loop Back to Design Ops

When post-launch data reveals issues, re-enter the design process:

| Signal                        | Re-Entry Command          | Action                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Users confused by navigation  | `/map`                    | Rethink IA with real usage data |
| Users not finding features    | `/audit`                  | Heuristic re-evaluation         |
| Users abandoning flows        | `/audit`                  | Flow audit with drop-off data   |
| Poor visual quality feedback  | `/grade`                  | Visual quality re-score         |
| Accessibility complaints      | `/a11y`                   | Accessibility re-audit          |
| New competitors emerged       | `/benchmark`              | Competitive re-analysis         |
| Users requesting new features | `/brief` then `/research` | New design cycle                |
| Conversion below target       | `/onboard`                | Rethink onboarding              |
| High bounce rate              | `/style`                  | Visual direction reassessment   |
| Content clarity issues        | `/audit`                  | Content audit                   |

## Quality Gates

The output MUST include:

- [ ] All 8 pre-launch categories with per-item status
- [ ] Each item with evidence or reason for status
- [ ] Blocking issues separated from recommendations
- [ ] Platform-appropriate checks (web items skipped for native mobile, vice versa)
- [ ] Legal requirements matched to target markets
- [ ] Clear overall verdict: READY / NOT READY / READY WITH WARNINGS
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard with specific metrics, targets, and tools
- [ ] Review cadence covering Week 1 through Month 3+
- [ ] At least 4 feedback channels with setup instructions
- [ ] Priority framework (P0-P3) with decision matrix

- Metrics without targets or thresholds
- Vague timelines
