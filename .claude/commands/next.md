# Next — What Should I Do Now?

A compact navigation aid that suggests the best next command based on context. Not an analysis -- a wayfinding tool. Keep output short and action-oriented.

## Command Reference

The 39 commands organized by tier:

**MAKE** (21): `/fix`, `/style`, `/palette`, `/type`, `/layout`, `/wireframe`, `/screen`, `/component`, `/page`, `/tokens`, `/form`, `/nav`, `/animate`, `/icon`, `/dark`, `/responsive`, `/onboard`, `/generate`, `/remix`, `/figma`, `/scroll`

**REVIEW** (7): `/audit`, `/roast`, `/grade`, `/qa`, `/a11y`, `/before-after`, `/ai-audit`

**PLAN** (7): `/brief`, `/research`, `/inspo`, `/benchmark`, `/map`, `/measure`, `/preflight`

**Utility** (4): `/start`, `/design-ops`, `/next`, `/status`

## Common Progressions

These are typical sequences, not mandatory order:

```
/fix → /before-after → /grade            (slop → cuisine fast track)
/style → /screen → /fix → /grade         (build and polish)
/brief → /style → /screen                (fast track)
/style → /tokens → /screen               (system-first)
/screen → /roast → /remix                (iterate loop)
/audit → /a11y → /roast → /grade         (full review)
/style → /screen → /qa → /preflight      (ship track)
/qa project → /fix                        (codebase cleanup)
```

## Protocol

### Step 1: Detect Context

- Scan conversation for the most recent Design Ops command(s) run
- Identify what outputs exist (style decisions, screens, audits, etc.)
- If no commands have been run, recommend `/fix` (if AI code visible) or `/style`
- Utility commands (`/next`, `/status`, `/design-ops`) don't count as steps

### Step 2: Recommend Next Command

Based on what exists and what's missing, suggest the highest-value next command.

**Priority logic**:

1. If user just pasted AI-generated code → `/fix`
2. If `/fix` was just run → `/before-after` (show the transformation)
3. If `/before-after` was run → `/grade` (get the score)
4. If no style direction exists → `/style [sector]`
5. If style exists but no screens → `/screen [type]`
6. If screens exist but no review → `/roast`
7. If review done with issues → `/fix` or `/remix`
8. If quality is good → `/grade` (get the score)
9. If ready to ship → `/preflight`
10. If nothing exists and user is exploring → `/brief`

### Step 3: Handle Edge Cases

- **Everything looks done**: Suggest `/preflight` or celebrate. Recommend `/status` for full review.
- **User jumped around**: Note what's missing without judgment. Just mention it as available.
- **No context at all**: Recommend `/fix` if AI-generated code is visible, `/style [sector]` for builders, or `/brief` for planners.

## Output Format

```
## Next Step

You just ran: `/[last-command]` -- [short description of what it produced]

---

### Recommended

> **`/[next-command]`** [optional args]
> [One sentence: what this does and why it follows naturally from what you just did]

---

### Other Options
- `/[option-1]` -- [why you might want this instead]
- `/[option-2]` -- [why you might want this instead]
- `/[option-3]` -- [why you might want this instead]

### Worth Revisiting
[Only if something valuable was skipped]
- `/[skipped]` -- [brief reason it's worth doing]

---
See all commands: `/design-ops` | See progress: `/status`
```

The output should be compact -- 15-25 lines maximum. Get the user to the next command fast.
