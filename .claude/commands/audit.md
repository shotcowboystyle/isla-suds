# Audit — Comprehensive Design Audit

## Before running

This command needs a product, screen, or codebase to audit.

If the user invoked it with nothing and no target is evident from the conversation or open files, ask for it in one plain-language question and stop. Do not invent a target and do not produce generic output in place of the real work — output about something imaginary reads as authoritative and is worthless.

If a target is evident from context, use it and say which one you picked.

Run every diagnostic lens against a design in a single pass. This is the master audit command — it evaluates heuristics, cognitive load, user flows, dark patterns, responsive edge cases, content quality, cognitive load analysis (Laws of UX, Gestalt, attention mapping, decision architecture), and produces a unified score with a priority roadmap.

**Accepts**: Code (file paths or pasted), screenshot description, URL description, or Figma reference.

**Section targeting**: Run the full audit or request specific sections:

- `/audit` — Full audit (all 6 sections)
- `/audit heuristic` or `/audit section-a` — Heuristic only
- `/audit cognitive` or `/audit section-b` — Cognitive only
- `/audit flow` or `/audit section-c` — Flow only
- `/audit fortify` or `/audit section-d` — Fortification only
- `/audit slop` or `/audit section-d6` — AI Slop Analysis only
- `/audit cogload` or `/audit section-e` — Cognitive Load Analysis only
- `/audit score` or `/audit section-f` — Summary score only (requires prior sections)
- `/audit a11y` — Redirects to `/a11y` (standalone accessibility audit)

---

## Pre-Audit: Context Gathering

Before running any section, establish the baseline:

1. **What is being audited**: Component, screen, flow, or full application
2. **Design intent**: What was the designer trying to achieve? What problem does this solve?
3. **Target users**: Who uses this? Sophistication level, context, accessibility needs
4. **Sector**: Industry determines what counts as a violation vs. an intentional convention
5. **Platform**: Web, iOS, Android, cross-platform, responsive targets
6. **Constraints**: Timeline, technical, business trade-offs the designer operated within
7. **Prior Design Ops outputs**: Check for `/style`, `/benchmark`, `/grade`, `/tokens`, `/screen` outputs. Consume them as baseline context if available
8. **Specific concerns**: Does the designer suspect weak areas? Prioritize those

If the user provides limited context, proceed with what is available and flag assumptions. Do not block on missing information.

## Section A: Heuristic Audit

Evaluate against Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics with cognitive principle grounding for every finding.

### A.1 — Heuristic Evaluation (H1-H10)

For each heuristic, evaluate whether the design complies, partially complies, or violates:

| ID  | Heuristic                                               | Core Question                                                                                                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| H1  | Visibility of System Status                             | Does the system always tell the user what is happening, within reasonable time?                                     |
| H2  | Match Between System and Real World                     | Does the system use the user's language, follow real-world conventions, and present information in a natural order? |
| H3  | User Control and Freedom                                | Can users undo, redo, and exit unwanted states without penalty?                                                     |
| H4  | Consistency and Standards                               | Do similar elements behave the same way? Are platform conventions followed?                                         |
| H5  | Error Prevention                                        | Does the design prevent errors before they happen through constraints, confirmations, and defaults?                 |
| H6  | Recognition Rather Than Recall                          | Is all necessary information visible or easily retrievable without memorization?                                    |
| H7  | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use                       | Does the interface serve both novice and expert users with shortcuts and customization?                             |
| H8  | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design                         | Does every element serve a purpose? Is signal-to-noise ratio optimized?                                             |
| H9  | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors | Are error messages expressed in plain language, indicating the problem and suggesting a solution?                   |
| H10 | Help and Documentation                                  | Is help available, searchable, focused on the user's task, and concise?                                             |

### A.2 — Finding Documentation

For EACH finding, document:

- **Heuristic violated**: H1-H10 identifier
- **Underlying cognitive principle**: Every heuristic violation has a deeper cognitive reason. Cite it:
  - H1 violation -> Doherty Threshold (system feels unresponsive) or Zeigarnik Effect (incomplete tasks create anxiety)
  - H2 violation -> Mental Model theory (interface doesn't match user's existing understanding)
  - H3 violation -> Learned Helplessness (user loses sense of control)
  - H4 violation -> Jakob's Law (users transfer expectations from other products)
  - H5 violation -> Cognitive Load Theory (user is forced to hold too much in working memory to avoid errors)
  - H6 violation -> Miller's Law (interface demands recall of >7 items instead of showing them)
  - H7 violation -> Power Law of Practice (experts need accelerators to maintain engagement)
  - H8 violation -> Signal-to-Noise Ratio (irrelevant information competes with relevant)
  - H9 violation -> Error Recovery Theory (users cannot self-correct without actionable guidance)
  - H10 violation -> Situated Cognition (help must be contextual to be useful)
- **Location**: Exact element, component, or screen where the issue occurs
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the problem
- **Severity**: Use the Nielsen severity scale:
  - **0 — Cosmetic**: Not a usability problem unless extra time is available
  - **1 — Minor**: Cosmetic problem that doesn't affect task completion
  - **2 — Moderate**: Users can work around it, but it causes delay or frustration
  - **3 — Major**: Significant usability problem that causes task failure for some users
  - **4 — Catastrophe**: Must be fixed before release. Blocks task completion or causes data loss
- **Recommendation**: Specific, actionable fix
- **Code fix**: When code is provided, include corrected code

### A.3 — Mental Model Assessment

Verify whether the interface communicates a clear, correct mental model:

- **Conceptual model**: Does the interface clearly communicate what this system is and how it works?
- **Navigational model**: Can the user predict where actions will take them? Is the information architecture intuitive?
- **Interaction model**: Do controls behave the way the user expects based on their appearance? (e.g., does something that looks clickable respond to clicks?)
- **Model gaps**: Where does the interface's model diverge from the user's likely expectation? Flag these as HIGH SEVERITY — mental model mismatches cause the deepest usability failures

## Section B: Cognitive Audit

Audit against cognitive psychology principles — Laws of UX, Gestalt principles, cognitive biases, attention science, and memory constraints.

### B.1 — Laws of UX Evaluation

Evaluate compliance with key Laws of UX:

| Law                            | What to Check                                                                                             | Violation Example                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hick's Law**                 | Decision time increases logarithmically with number of choices. Count choices per viewport.               | Navigation with 15+ top-level items. Settings page with 30 uncategorized toggles. Dropdown with 50+ unsearchable options. |
| **Miller's Law**               | Working memory holds 7±2 items. Count information chunks per section.                                     | Dashboard showing 12 ungrouped metrics. Form with 15 fields on one step. Tab bar with 8 items.                            |
| **Fitts's Law**                | Time to target depends on distance and size. Check CTA sizes and positions.                               | Tiny "Submit" button far from form. Close button as small X in corner. Important action requires precision click.         |
| **Jakob's Law**                | Users spend most time on other sites — they expect yours to work like those. Check convention compliance. | Logo in the center instead of top-left. Cart icon on the left side. Search that doesn't use a magnifying glass icon.      |
| **Aesthetic-Usability Effect** | Users perceive attractive designs as more usable. Rate overall aesthetic quality.                         | Functional but visually unpolished interface creates perception of poor usability.                                        |
| **Doherty Threshold**          | System response must be <400ms for flow state. Check perceived performance.                               | No loading indicators. Slow transitions. No optimistic UI for common actions.                                             |
| **Peak-End Rule**              | Users judge experience by its peak moment and end. Check critical and final moments.                      | No success celebration on completion. Error states that feel harsh. Abrupt endings.                                       |
| **Von Restorff Effect**        | Distinctive items are more memorable. Check if CTAs stand out.                                            | Primary CTA doesn't visually differentiate from secondary actions. Everything is the same visual weight.                  |
| **Zeigarnik Effect**           | People remember uncompleted tasks. Check progress indication.                                             | Multi-step form with no progress bar. Task list with no completion states. Onboarding with no progress indicator.         |
| **Serial Position Effect**     | First and last items in a list are best remembered. Check ordering of menus and lists.                    | Most important nav item buried in the middle. Critical settings in the middle of a long list.                             |
| **Tesler's Law**               | Complexity is conserved — if the interface hides it, someone still absorbs it. Check where it landed.     | Simplified UI that pushes the work onto the user's memory or onto support.                                                |
| **Postel's Law**               | Be liberal in what you accept from users. Check input parsing and formatting tolerance.                   | Phone field that rejects spaces or dashes. Date field that demands one exact format.                                      |

For each law, rate:

- **Compliant** (actively applied)
- **Neutral** (not applicable or no violation)
- **Violation** (law is violated with negative UX impact)

### B.2 — Gestalt Principles Evaluation

- **Proximity**: Are related elements close together? Are unrelated elements sufficiently separated?
- **Similarity**: Do similar elements share consistent visual treatment?
- **Closure**: Can users complete partial patterns mentally? Are shapes and regions implied effectively?
- **Continuity**: Do visual flows guide the eye in the intended direction?
- **Common Region**: Are groups enclosed or backgrounded to show relationship?
- **Figure-Ground**: Is the primary content clearly distinguished from background?
- **Common Fate**: Do elements that function together animate or move together?

### B.3 — Cognitive Load Analysis

- **Intrinsic load**: Is task complexity managed through decomposition (wizard, progressive form)?
- **Extraneous load**: What unnecessary cognitive demands does the design impose? (confusing labels, hidden controls, inconsistent patterns, visual noise)
- **Germane load**: Does the design build reusable mental schemas through consistency?
- **Working memory demand**: At any single step, how many items must the user hold in working memory? Flag if > 4

### B.4 — Cognitive Bias Scan

Scan for bias exploitation or risk:

| Bias              | Check                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anchoring         | Are reference points fair or manipulative?              |
| Default bias      | Do defaults serve users or the business?                |
| Confirmation bias | Does the interface surface disconfirming information?   |
| Framing effect    | Is information framed neutrally or manipulatively?      |
| Choice overload   | Are there too many options without curation?            |
| Sunk cost framing | Does the design leverage past investment to trap users? |
| FOMO/scarcity     | Are urgency signals real or fabricated?                 |
| Social proof      | Is social proof genuine or manufactured?                |

### B.5 — Attention Mapping

Analyze where user attention flows:

1. **Entry Point**: Where does the eye land first on each screen? Is this the most important element?
2. **Scanning Pattern**: Does the layout support natural scanning (F-pattern for text, Z-pattern for marketing)?
3. **Visual Hierarchy Score**: Rank elements by visual weight (size, color, contrast, position). Does this ranking match the information priority?
4. **Distraction Audit**: Identify elements that compete for attention when they shouldn't (animations, bright colors on non-priority elements, decorative elements that distract from content)
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Is information revealed at the right time, or is everything shown at once?

### B.6 — Decision Architecture

Evaluate how the interface structures user decisions:

- **Choice Architecture**: Are default options set appropriately? Are destructive actions guarded?
- **Cognitive Friction**: Where does the interface create unnecessary mental effort? (Unclear labels, ambiguous icons, missing context)
- **Error Prevention**: Does the design prevent errors before they happen? (Disabled invalid options, confirmation for destructive actions, undo capability)
- **Mental Model Alignment**: Does the interface's conceptual model match how users think about the task?
- **Information Scent**: Can users predict what they'll find behind links/buttons from the label alone?

### B.7 — Cognitive Health Score

Calculate a composite cognitive load score:

| Dimension           | Weight | Score (0-10) | Criteria                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information Density | 20%    | —            | 10: Right amount of info per viewport. 1: Overwhelming or barren                 |
| Decision Complexity | 20%    | —            | 10: Guided decisions, clear defaults. 1: Too many choices, no guidance           |
| Visual Noise        | 15%    | —            | 10: Clean, focused. 1: Cluttered, competing elements                             |
| Consistency         | 15%    | —            | 10: Predictable patterns. 1: Every screen is different                           |
| Memory Load         | 15%    | —            | 10: Recognition over recall, persistent context. 1: Must remember previous steps |
| Learning Curve      | 15%    | —            | 10: Immediately intuitive. 1: Requires instruction manual                        |

**Cognitive Load Rating:**

- 8-10: Effortless — interface disappears, users focus on tasks
- 6-7: Manageable — minor cognitive friction in specific areas
- 4-5: Taxing — users must think about the interface, not their task
- 1-3: Overwhelming — interface creates anxiety, confusion, or decision paralysis

#### Composite

Score each domain 1-10:

| Domain                | Score Criteria                                                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Decision Architecture | Choice count, defaults, progressive disclosure                        |
| Visual Cognition      | Gestalt compliance, hierarchy clarity, figure-ground                  |
| Memory Load           | Working memory demand, recognition vs. recall, chunking               |
| Attention Management  | Focus direction, interruption protection, sustained attention support |
| Bias Ethics           | Fair defaults, neutral framing, no dark patterns                      |

**Cognitive Health Score**: Average of 5 domains (X/10)

## Section C: Flow Audit

Audit a complete user journey across multiple screens or steps, identifying friction, drop-off risks, and emotional arc quality.

### C.1 — Flow Classification

- **Flow type**: Onboarding, signup, checkout, settings change, content creation, search-to-action, account recovery, upgrade/upsell, or custom
- **Criticality**: Revenue-critical, retention-critical, trust-critical, or utility
- **Entry point**: Where users come from
- **Success state**: What "done" looks like
- **Platform context**: Mobile, desktop, cross-device, embedded

### C.2 — Step Mapping

Enumerate every distinct screen, modal, or interaction step from entry to completion:

For each step document:

- Screen name and purpose
- Primary action (the ONE thing the user should do)
- Secondary actions available
- Data collected or displayed
- Decisions the user must make
- Branching paths (conditional steps, error branches, optional steps)
- System-initiated steps (loading, processing, verification emails, SMS codes)

Calculate:

- Total step count vs. recommended step count for this flow type
- Estimated time-to-completion

### C.3 — Per-Step Cognitive Load

For each step:

- Count decisions (Hick's Law — each decision adds friction)
- Count input fields (Miller's Law — keep chunks to 4 +/- 1)
- Assess visual complexity (information density, competing CTAs, distractions)
- Track cumulative cognitive load across the flow (load should not monotonically increase)
- Flag steps where load spikes unexpectedly

### C.4 — Drop-Off Risk Assessment

Rate each step 1-5 for drop-off risk based on:

- Effort required
- Value unclear to user
- Trust barrier present
- Technical friction (slow loading, complex input)
- Interruption likelihood

Identify the "valley of death" — the step with highest drop-off risk.

Check:

- Is value demonstrated before effort is demanded? (Reciprocity Principle)
- Does progress indication exist and is it accurate?
- Can users save progress and return later?

### C.5 — Emotional Arc Analysis (Peak-End Rule)

Map emotional valence per step:

```
Step 1: ████████░░ Curiosity (positive)
Step 2: ██████░░░░ Effort (neutral)
Step 3: ████░░░░░░ Friction (negative)  <- Valley of Death
Step 4: ████████░░ Relief (positive)    <- Designed Peak
Step 5: ██████████ Accomplishment       <- Strong End
```

Verify:

- At least one designed peak moment (positive surprise, social proof, personalization)
- End state is emotionally positive (confirmation, celebration, immediate value delivery)
- No negative emotional clusters (consecutive friction steps without relief)

### C.6 — Error Recovery Mid-Flow

- What happens if the user makes an error at step 3 of 7? Do they lose progress?
- Is back-navigation safe (no data loss)?
- Can users save progress and return later?
- Are error messages contextual and recovery-oriented?

### C.7 — Flow Dimension Scoring

Score each dimension 1-10:

| Dimension             | What It Measures                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flow Efficiency       | Ratio of necessary to total steps — can steps be cut or merged? |
| Cognitive Progression | Does cognitive load distribute well or spike dangerously?       |
| Emotional Arc         | Is the Peak-End Rule satisfied? Delight and strong closure?     |
| Error Recovery        | Can users recover from mistakes without restarting?             |
| Completion Likelihood | Given all factors, what percentage of users will finish?        |

**Overall Flow Score**: Average of 5 dimensions (X/10)

---

## Section D: Fortification

Scan for defensive design issues — dark patterns, responsive edge cases, content/tone, and error recovery.

### D.1 — Dark Pattern Scan

Scan for 20+ deceptive design categories:

**Coercion patterns**:

- Confirmshaming — guilt-tripping the user into opting in
- Forced continuity — free trial converts to paid without clear warning
- Roach motel — easy to sign up, impossible to cancel
- Forced action — requiring account creation or social sharing to proceed

**Sneaking patterns**:

- Hidden costs — fees revealed only at checkout
- Sneak into basket — items added without explicit consent
- Bait and switch — advertising one thing, delivering another
- Hidden subscription — recurring charge buried in terms

**Interface manipulation**:

- Trick questions — double negatives or confusing opt-in/opt-out toggles
- Misdirection — visual design draws attention away from important information
- Disguised ads — ads styled to look like content or navigation
- False hierarchy — making the company-preferred option visually dominant

**Privacy violations**:

- Privacy zuckering — confusing privacy settings defaulting to maximum data sharing
- Address book leeching — requesting contacts without clear purpose
- Surveillance indicators — excessive data collection for the service provided

**Urgency/scarcity**:

- Fake urgency — countdown timers with no real deadline
- Fake scarcity — "Only 2 left!" without real inventory limits
- Fake social proof — fabricated reviews or user counts

**Obstruction**:

- Hard to cancel — cancellation flow harder than signup
- Hidden settings — important controls buried deep
- Comparison prevention — making plan comparison deliberately difficult

For each detected pattern, document:

- **Pattern name and category**
- **Location**: Specific component, screen, or flow
- **Severity**: Illegal (violates FTC/GDPR/DSA), Deceptive, Manipulative, or Questionable
- **Regulatory risk**: Specific laws/regulations that apply
- **Ethical redesign**: How to achieve the business goal without the dark pattern

If clean: "No dark patterns detected across 20+ categories scanned."

### D.2 — AI Trust Audit

**Skip if no AI features are present.** Output "N/A — no AI features detected."

If AI features exist, audit:

| Dimension    | Score (1-10) | Questions                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transparency |              | Does the user know when AI is deciding? Are outputs labeled? Are limitations disclosed? |
| Control      |              | Can the user override AI? Opt out? Provide feedback? Escalate to human?                 |
| Safety       |              | What happens when AI is wrong? Guardrails against harm? Bias monitoring?                |
| Usability    |              | Does AI enhance or complicate UX? Is confidence communicated?                           |

**AI Trust Score**: Average of 4 dimensions (X/10)

### D.3 — Content & Tone Review

**Clarity**:

- Is every label, button, and message unambiguous?
- Can the user predict what will happen before they act?
- Flag jargon, unexplained acronyms, or insider language

**Tone consistency**:

- Does voice match throughout the product?
- Does tone match brand and sector expectations?
- Is tone appropriate for context? (playful error messages for banking = mismatch)

**Inclusive language**:

- No gendered assumptions
- No ableist language ("see below" vs. "refer to")
- No cultural bias or untranslatable idioms
- No age-related assumptions

**Error messages**:

- Helpful and specific? (not "Something went wrong")
- Tell the user what happened AND what to do next?
- Friendly tone without blame?
- Provide a recovery path (retry button, support link, alternative action)?

**CTAs**:

- Action-oriented with clear outcome? ("Create Account" not "Submit")
- Consistent verb patterns?
- Button text matches the result? ("Delete Account" not "Continue" for destructive actions)

**Readability**:

- Flesch-Kincaid grade level appropriate for audience
- Sentence length reasonable (avg <20 words)
- Paragraph length manageable (max 3-4 sentences in UI)

**i18n readiness**:

- Text externalized from code (not hardcoded strings)?
- Date/number formatting locale-aware?
- Text expansion room (German/French can be 30% longer)?
- No text embedded in images?
- RTL layout considerations if applicable?

Format rewrites as: "Current: [X] -> Recommended: [Y] -- Reason: [Z]"

### D.4 — Responsive & Cross-Device Edge Cases

Check at 5 breakpoints:

| Breakpoint           | Key Checks                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mobile (375px)**   | Single column? Touch targets >= 44px? Line length <= 75 chars? Mobile nav pattern? No horizontal scroll? |
| **Tablet (768px)**   | 2-column adaptation? Touch + pointer both work? Modal sizing appropriate? Split view patterns?           |
| **Laptop (1024px)**  | Multi-column + sidebar? Hover states present? Keyboard nav functional?                                   |
| **Desktop (1280px)** | Full layout as designed? Max-width container? Comfortable density?                                       |
| **Wide (1536px+)**   | Content constrained to readable width? No awkward stretching? Grid fills proportionally?                 |

**Cross-cutting checks**:

- No horizontal scrolling at any breakpoint
- Print stylesheet if content is printable
- Orientation changes handled (portrait to landscape)
- Input mode transitions (touch to keyboard to mouse)

### D.5 — Microcopy & Error Recovery Deep-Dive

- Every form field: label, placeholder, helper text, error message — all present and clear?
- Empty states: Do they explain what to do, not just say "No items"?
- Loading states: Skeleton screens, progress indicators, or optimistic UI?
- Success states: Confirmation with next action?
- Destructive action confirmations: Clear consequences stated?
- Undo availability: Can the user reverse the last action?

### D.6 — AI Slop Analysis

A thorough scan for AI-generated UI patterns that indicate the design was output by an AI with little or no human design refinement. This goes deeper than a surface check — it evaluates systemic design quality gaps that AI tools consistently produce.

#### D.6.1 — Visual Homogeneity Scan

- **Default palette detection**: Does the design use only Tailwind defaults without customization? Check for the "purple gradient epidemic" — default indigo/violet palette (bg-indigo-500, bg-purple-600, bg-violet-500, from-indigo-500 to-purple-600). Flag white/near-white backgrounds with purple accents as the #1 AI-generated look
- **Component homogeneity**: Do all components follow the same generic card + rounded-lg + shadow-md pattern? Are there any components with unique visual treatments?
- **Hero section analysis**: Flag hero sections with centered text on gradient backgrounds — the most common AI layout pattern
- **Color palette origin**: Is the palette a stock Tailwind palette, a stock theme palette, or a custom/intentional palette? Evidence: custom CSS properties, extended theme config, or raw Tailwind utility classes
- **Visual monotony score**: Rate 1-10 how visually homogeneous the design is (1 = rich variety, 10 = every section looks identical)

#### D.6.2 — Design System Gap Analysis

For each category, determine whether the design has an intentional system or is using arbitrary values:

| Category                    | Has System? | Evidence                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design tokens**           | Yes/No      | Are there CSS custom properties, theme config, or hardcoded values?                                           |
| **Type scale**              | Yes/No      | Do font sizes follow a consistent ratio (1.2, 1.25, 1.333, 1.5, 1.618) or are sizes arbitrary?                |
| **Spacing system**          | Yes/No      | Is there a consistent spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64) or arbitrary padding/margin values?        |
| **Border-radius scale**     | Yes/No      | Is there a consistent radius scale or mixed values (rounded-md here, rounded-lg there, rounded-xl elsewhere)? |
| **Elevation/shadow system** | Yes/No      | Is there a deliberate shadow hierarchy (sm, md, lg mapped to elevation levels) or random shadow usage?        |
| **Semantic colors**         | Yes/No      | Are semantic colors used (primary, error, success, warning) or raw color values (bg-red-500, bg-green-400)?   |
| **Font pairing**            | Yes/No      | Is there an intentional heading/body font pairing, or a single font with no typographic contrast?             |

**Design System Score**: Count of "Yes" answers out of 7. Below 3 = strong indicator of AI-generated output.

#### D.6.3 — State Coverage Audit

For each interactive component found in the design, check whether these states are implemented:

| State              | Description                 | What to Look For                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Default**        | Resting state               | Component renders correctly at rest                          |
| **Hover**          | Mouse over                  | Visual change on hover (color shift, underline, shadow lift) |
| **Focus**          | Keyboard focus              | focus-visible ring or equivalent indicator                   |
| **Active/Pressed** | Click/tap down              | Visual compression, color darken, or scale reduction         |
| **Disabled**       | Not interactive             | Reduced opacity, cursor-not-allowed, aria-disabled           |
| **Loading**        | Async operation in progress | Spinner, skeleton, shimmer, or progress indicator            |
| **Error**          | Invalid or failed           | Red border, error message, recovery action                   |
| **Empty**          | No data                     | Illustration or message explaining what to do                |
| **Success**        | Completed                   | Confirmation message, checkmark, green indicator             |

Document findings per component:

| Component | Default | Hover | Focus | Active | Disabled | Loading | Error | Empty | Success | Coverage |
| --------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ------- | -------- |
| [name]    | Y/N     | Y/N   | Y/N   | Y/N    | Y/N      | Y/N     | Y/N   | Y/N   | Y/N     | X/9      |

**State Coverage Score**: Average coverage across all interactive components. Below 4/9 = strong indicator of AI-generated output.

#### D.6.4 — AI Slop Severity Rating

Based on findings from D.6.1, D.6.2, and D.6.3, assign an overall AI Slop severity:

| Rating       | Criteria                                                                                                  | Action                                                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **None**     | Custom palette, intentional type system, full state coverage, visual variety                              | No action needed                                                      |
| **Mild**     | 1-2 default patterns detected, mostly custom design, minor state gaps                                     | Note in findings, low priority                                        |
| **Moderate** | Stock palette with minimal customization, weak type system, several missing states                        | Recommend `/fix` pass to customize defaults and add missing states    |
| **Severe**   | Default Tailwind palette, no type scale, most states missing, generic card layouts everywhere             | Strongly recommend `/fix` — design needs significant human refinement |
| **Critical** | Full default palette, no design system, minimal states, cookie-cutter AI layout, purple gradient syndrome | This is raw AI output. Run `/fix` immediately before any other work   |

For the assigned rating, provide:

- **Rating**: [None / Mild / Moderate / Severe / Critical]
- **Evidence**: List the specific findings that justify the rating (cite D.6.1, D.6.2, D.6.3 findings)
- **Recommended action**: If Moderate or above, recommend `/fix` with specific areas to address

## Section E: Summary Score & Priority Roadmap

### E.1 — Composite Score Calculation

Compute the overall audit score (0-100):

| Section          | Weight | Score Source                                 | Raw Score |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| A: Heuristic     | 20%    | Usability score from A (1-100)               |           |
| B: Cognitive     | 35%    | Cognitive Health Score (1-10, scaled to 100) |           |
| C: Flow          | 15%    | Flow Score (1-10, scaled to 100)             |           |
| D: Fortification | 15%    | Weighted from D.1-D.5 (1-10, scaled to 100)  |           |
| E: Consistency   | 15%    | Cross-section coherence (do findings align?) |           |

**Overall Design Health Score: X/100**

Score interpretation:

- **90-100**: Ship-ready. Exceptional design with minor polish opportunities
- **75-89**: Strong. Ready to ship with targeted improvements
- **60-74**: Competent. Needs work on specific weak areas before shipping
- **40-59**: Needs significant work. Multiple critical issues across sections
- **0-39**: Redesign recommended. Fundamental problems in most areas

### E.2 — Priority Roadmap

Consolidate ALL findings from sections A-E into three tiers:

**Must-Fix (before ship)**:

- Severity 3-4 heuristic violations
- Critical cognitive load issues
- Dark patterns classified as Illegal or Deceptive
- Valley of Death steps with no recovery
- Missing error states on critical flows
- WCAG AA failures (redirect to `/a11y` for detailed fixes)

**Should-Fix (current sprint)**:

- Severity 2 heuristic violations
- Moderate cognitive load spikes
- Manipulative or Questionable dark patterns
- High drop-off risk steps
- Tone inconsistencies in critical flows
- Responsive breakpoint degradations

**Could-Improve (backlog)**:

- Severity 0-1 heuristic findings
- Cognitive optimization opportunities
- Content clarity improvements
- i18n readiness gaps
- Delight opportunities (Peak-End Rule improvements)
- Polish-level responsive adjustments

For EACH item in the roadmap:

- Finding summary (one line)
- Section source (A/B/C/D/E)
- Severity level
- Location in the interface
- Specific fix recommendation
- UX principle cited
- Effort estimate (quick win / half-day / multi-day / strategic)

### E.3 — Cross-Section Pattern Analysis

Identify themes that appear across multiple sections:

- If the same component fails in heuristic audit AND cognitive audit AND flow audit, it is a systemic problem
- If dark patterns and tone issues overlap, there may be an organizational culture issue
- If responsive and flow issues overlap, the mobile experience likely needs dedicated attention

Call out the top 3 systemic patterns with recommendations.

---

### E.4 — Domain Roll-Up

Sections A-D score the audit's own lenses. This rolls the same findings up by
design domain, so the reader can see which discipline is weakest rather than
which section ran longest. Score each 0-10 and name the finding that set it.

| Domain                            | Score | Weakest finding |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| Usability and heuristics          |       |                 |
| Cognitive load and attention      |       |                 |
| Information architecture and flow |       |                 |
| Visual design and hierarchy       |       |                 |
| Interaction and motion            |       |                 |
| Content and microcopy             |       |                 |
| Accessibility                     |       |                 |
| Responsive and cross-device       |       |                 |
| Trust, ethics, and dark patterns  |       |                 |
| Performance perception            |       |                 |

Do not peg this list to the plugin's skill count — it is ten design domains, and
it stays ten regardless of how many skills Design Ops ships.

Group the roadmap that follows into quick wins (under a day), medium lifts (under
a sprint), and strategic work (needs a decision, not just time).

## Quality Gates

The output MUST include:

- [ ] All 6 sections completed (or targeted section if user specified)
- [ ] Every finding has severity, location, fix recommendation, and UX principle cited
- [ ] Heuristic findings grounded in cognitive principles (not just "violates H4")
- [ ] Cognitive scores justified with specific observations
- [ ] Flow diagram with per-step cognitive load and drop-off risk
- [ ] Emotional arc visualization
- [ ] Dark pattern scan covering 20+ categories
- [ ] Content review with specific rewrites for every failing text
- [ ] Responsive check at 5 breakpoints
- [ ] Composite score computed with visible weights
- [ ] Priority roadmap with three tiers and effort estimates
- [ ] Systemic pattern analysis across sections
- [ ] Code fixes included when code input is provided
- [ ] AI Slop Analysis completed (D.6) with visual homogeneity scan, design system gap analysis, state coverage audit, and severity rating
- [ ] Cognitive Load Analysis completed (E) with Laws of UX evaluation, Gestalt audit, attention mapping, decision architecture, and composite cognitive load score

The output MUST NOT include:

- Vague findings ("could be better", "needs work") — every issue must be specific and actionable
- Scores without justification — every score must explain what earned or lost points
- Recommendations without grounding — every fix must cite a UX principle
- Dark pattern scan checking fewer than 20 categories
- AI trust audit on products without AI features (skip cleanly)
- Responsive findings without specific breakpoint data
- Missing roadmap — every finding must route to a tier with a fix
