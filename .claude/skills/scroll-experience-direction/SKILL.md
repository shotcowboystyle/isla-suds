# Scroll Experience Direction — a cinematic site, art-directed per subject

A premium scroll site is not a page with animations added. It is a short film the visitor
drives with one finger. The scene has real depth, a subject that rests on something, a single
peak, and an ending that resolves instead of fading into a footer. Every site this skill
produces is designed **for its subject**. There is no house template, no canon of approved
sites, and no stock "world" to reuse. The direction comes from interviewing the user,
verifying the subject, and sourcing live references this session.

`/scroll` runs this skill end to end. Other Design Ops skills supply the parts:

- `reference-intelligence` sources the wall and grades the build against it.
- `animation-recipe-library` supplies the GSAP, Lenis and R3F code.
- `ai-design-generation` and `kie-ai.md` produce the imagery the subject still lacks.
- `design-memory` holds the decisions between stages.

## Mental model

- **Truth before pixels.** Real product, real logo, real facts. Generated imagery fills
  gaps around authentic assets; it never replaces them. Anything that cannot be verified
  stays out of the copy.
- **Depth is planned, not decorated.** Every hero is a contract of independent planes. Each
  plane has its own rate. Subjects stay on their contact points. Each act is written as its
  opening, midpoint and exit before any asset exists.
- **The subject picks the renderer.** Photographic compositing, real 3D, authored video, an
  image sequence or plain CSS. Choose by what the subject needs to do: rotate, catch light,
  move through space, or just hold still beautifully.
- **Every site is its own species.** Navigation, information order, the controls, the
  signature move and the ending are chosen for this offer. They are gated against every
  earlier build so site #12 cannot quietly repeat site #3.
- **Phones get their own direction.** A phone layout is recomposed, not shrunk.
- **Only a rendered frame is evidence.** A passing build proves nothing about how it looks.
  Frames captured at the opening, midpoint and exit of every act, on desktop, phone, reduced
  motion, no-JS and no-WebGL, are the evidence.

## Stage loop

| # | Stage          | Gate (must hold before the next stage)                                   | Writes                                  |
| - | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 0 | Interview      | Creative authority is clear; brief approved or explicitly delegated      | `.design-ops/scroll/brief.md`           |
| 1 | Subject truth  | Official sources opened; every asset opened and described; unknowns listed | `scroll/subject.md`, `scroll/assets.json` |
| 2 | Sourcing       | 3-5 live references kept by the user, each with frame notes              | `refs/` via `/inspo`, `scroll/sourcing.md` |
| 3 | Plan           | Fingerprint gate passes; user approves the plan                          | `scroll/plan.json`                      |
| 4 | Assets         | Every image looked at; edges checked; provenance recorded                | `scroll/assets/`, `scroll/assets.json`  |
| 5 | Build          | Runs locally; tokens come from `style.json` if it exists                 | project source                          |
| 6 | Verify         | Frame report clean; board grade clears the wall; feel diff agrees        | `scroll/verify/`                        |
| 7 | Package        | Delivery gate passes at the package root; fingerprint row appended       | package dir, `fingerprints.ndjson`      |

One stage at a time. Never generate an asset before stage 3 is approved.

## Constants

- **Runtime:** follow `style.json` `project.framework`. Default to GSAP ScrollTrigger +
  Lenis, R3F (or vanilla Three.js outside React) for real 3D, and CSS for everything that
  needs no timeline. Never ship a bespoke scroll engine.
- **Acts:** 4-7 beats. A section that serves no beat is cut.
- **Peak:** exactly one. It gets the largest span, the largest asset budget, and quiet
  before it.
- **Scrub devices:** at most 2 per page. Never use the same device in two adjacent acts.
- **Parallax:** adjacent planes differ by 10-30% in rate. Several layers moving together
  count as one plane.
- **Fingerprint gate:** differ from every registry row on at least 4 of 6 dimensions.
- **Viewports verified:** 1440×900, 390×844, 360×640, plus reduced motion, no-JS and no-WebGL.
- **Contrast:** 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text and controls, measured on the
  composited frame and not on the CSS colour pair.
- **Registry:** `${DESIGN_OPS_HOME:-~/.design-ops}/fingerprints.ndjson`, append-only. Change
  the plan, never the log.

## Hard rules

| Never                                                        | Instead                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generate before the brief and the plan are approved          | Interview, verify, plan, get approval, then generate             |
| Invent stats, testimonials, prices, availability or dates    | Use verified facts, or an honest flow for the subject's state    |
| Recreate the real product or logo with a generator           | Pass the authentic asset as a reference on every shot            |
| Bake text into imagery                                       | Semantic HTML type over a planned empty area                     |
| Use a generic primitive as "the 3D product"                  | Model the real object, use the user's GLB, or choose compositing |
| Scale the desktop composition down for phones                | Recompose: crop, pivot, type position, travel and duration       |
| Add scroll-hint cues, "01 / 06" counters, an eyebrow on every heading | Let the composition invite the scroll                   |
| Fade the last act into a footer                              | A close that resolves and holds, and carries the user's choices  |
| Use a full-frame dark overlay to rescue contrast             | Recompose the empty area, add a local scrim, or regrade the plate |
| Reduce motion to zero                                        | Fewer and gentler moves: posters hold, scrubs become stills      |
| Treat a green build as visual proof                          | Read the captured frames                                         |

## Routing

For **starting a site**, or when the user hands over creative direction, read
`references/interview-and-subject.md` first. Nothing else runs until its gate holds.

For **the hero or any layered scene**, read `references/depth-and-states.md` before
writing a prompt or a line of markup.

For **deciding how a subject is rendered**, read `references/render-route.md`. Then go to
`animation-recipe-library` for the code: `gsap-scrolltrigger-recipes.md` for pin, scrub
and Lenis, and `cursor-text-3d-effects.md` for R3F.

For **making the site different from everything before it**, read
`references/uniqueness.md`. Run its fingerprint gate before asking for plan approval.

For **phones**, read `references/phone-direction.md` while planning, not after the
desktop build.

For **generating imagery or footage**, read `references/kie-ai.md`. If `KIE_AI_API_KEY`
is missing, print the specs and prompts for the user to run by hand. Never fail silently.

For **proving it works and shipping it**, read `references/verify-and-package.md`.

## Scripts

Resolve the plugin root once, the same way `/inspo` does:

```bash
DESIGN_OPS="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(dirname "$(dirname "$(find ~/.claude/plugins -path '*design-ops*/scripts/capture.mjs' -print -quit)")")}"
KIE="$DESIGN_OPS/skills/scroll-experience-direction/scripts/kie.mjs"
node "$KIE" probe                                   # key + credit balance
node "$DESIGN_OPS/scripts/capture.mjs" http://localhost:5173 --frames --out .design-ops/scroll/verify
```
