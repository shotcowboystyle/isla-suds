# UX Process Workflow — From Process to Product

## Foundation

The gap between "prompting an AI to generate UI" and "designing a product people love" is not capability — it's process. This skill bridges that gap by grounding every build session in established UX methodology, mapped to how developers actually work in the terminal.

### The Core Problem

Modern AI-assisted development (vibe coding) creates a dangerous shortcut:

```
Traditional:  Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test → Implement
Vibe coding:  Prompt → Ship → Hope
```

The result: pixel-perfect UIs that solve the wrong problems, look identical to every other AI-generated interface, and erode the developer's own design judgment over time (arXiv:2509.10652).

### The Solution

Ground yourself before you build. This skill provides:

1. **Process frameworks** — NNG, IDEO, Double Diamond, and 6 more methodologies adapted for terminal workflows
2. **The vibe coder's bridge** — Concrete checklists that slot UX thinking into AI-assisted development
3. **Academic foundations** — ISO 9241-210, Norman's 7 principles, cognitive laws that explain _why_ process matters
4. **Design Ops command mapping** — Every process phase maps to specific Design Ops commands

### The Speed Run: Process in 60 Seconds

For builders who won't read further — the entire UX process in one block:

```
BEFORE you prompt: "Who is this for, and what problem does it solve?"
WHILE it generates:  "Does this match the user's reality, or the AI's patterns?"
AFTER it generates:  Run /audit + /a11y. Fix severity 3-4. Ship.
```

That's it. Three questions. Two audits. Everything else in this skill is the _why_ behind those three lines.

### Real-World Impact: Process vs. No Process

| Metric                         | Without Process (Prompt → Ship)         | With Process (Ground → Build → Test) |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Screens shipped**            | 10 screens/day                          | 3 screens/day                        |
| **Screens users actually use** | 2-3 of 10                               | 3 of 3                               |
| **Accessibility violations**   | 15-25 per screen (average)              | 0-3 per screen                       |
| **Redesign cycles**            | 4-7 (because wrong problem)             | 1-2 (because right problem)          |
| **Time to "done"**             | Feels faster, takes longer              | Feels slower, ships sooner           |
| **User satisfaction**          | "It looks nice"                         | "It solves my problem"               |
| **Brand differentiation**      | Looks like every other AI-generated app | Looks like _your_ product            |

The math: 10 screens × 5 redesign cycles = 50 screen-builds to get 2-3 right.
vs. 3 screens × 1 redesign cycle = 6 screen-builds to get 3 right.

Process doesn't slow you down. **Skipping process slows you down.**

## NNG Design Thinking — The 6-Phase Framework

Nielsen Norman Group's design thinking model is the most widely-validated UX process. It organizes into three macro stages:

### Macro Stage 1: UNDERSTAND (Empathize + Define)

The stage most vibe coders skip entirely. You cannot design what you do not understand.

#### Phase 1: Empathize

**Goal**: Understand users' needs, pain points, and context through direct observation and engagement.

**Methods**:

- **Contextual inquiry** — Observe users in their natural environment performing real tasks
- **User interviews** — Semi-structured conversations focusing on behaviors, not opinions
- **Diary studies** — Longitudinal capture of experiences over days or weeks
- **Empathy mapping** — Synthesize what users Say, Think, Do, and Feel
- **Stakeholder interviews** — Understand business constraints, technical limitations, and organizational goals

**Key principle**: Empathy is not sympathy. It's not "feeling sorry for users." It's understanding their mental models, frustrations, and workarounds deeply enough to design for their actual reality.

**In terminal workflow**: Before prompting any AI to generate UI, spend 2 minutes answering:

- Who will use this? (Not "users" — a specific person with a specific job)
- What are they trying to accomplish? (Task, not feature)
- What's their current workaround? (They're solving this somehow today)
- What frustrates them about the current solution?
- What environment are they in? (Mobile on a train? Desktop in an office? Accessibility needs?)

**Design Ops mapping**: `/brief` (0.2) captures this as a structured problem statement.

#### Phase 2: Define

**Goal**: Synthesize empathy findings into a clear, actionable problem statement.

**Methods**:

- **Problem statement** — "Users who [X] need [Y] because [Z]"
- **How Might We questions** — Reframe problems as opportunities ("HMW make checkout feel instant?")
- **Personas** — Behavioral archetypes (not demographic stereotypes)
- **Jobs to Be Done** — Functional, emotional, and social jobs the product fulfills
- **User stories** — "As a [persona], I want [action] so that [outcome]"
- **Success criteria** — Measurable outcomes that define "done" (functional, usability, accessibility, business)

**Key principle**: A well-defined problem is half-solved. Most design failures trace to building the right solution to the wrong problem.

**In terminal workflow**: Write a single sentence: "Users who [X] need [Y] because [Z]." If you can't fill this in, you haven't empathized enough.

**Design Ops mapping**: `/brief` (0.2) generates the problem statement, persona, HMW questions, and success criteria.

### Macro Stage 2: EXPLORE (Ideate + Prototype)

Generate and test multiple solutions before committing.

#### Phase 3: Ideate

**Goal**: Generate a breadth of possible solutions without premature commitment.

**Methods**:

- **Brainstorming** — Quantity over quality, defer judgment, build on others' ideas
- **Crazy 8s** — 8 ideas in 8 minutes, forces divergent thinking
- **How Might We** — Each HMW question generates 3-5 potential solutions
- **Competitive analysis** — Study how others solve the same problem (not to copy — to understand the solution space)
- **Design patterns** — Known solutions to known problems (Design Ops' screen-flow-patterns catalog)
- **Sketching** — Low-fidelity exploration before any code or AI generation

**Key principle**: The first idea is almost never the best idea. Diverge before you converge.

**In terminal workflow**: Before prompting AI to generate a component, list 3 different approaches. Even 30 seconds of divergent thinking improves outcomes.

**Design Ops mapping**: `/style` (1.2) finds patterns; `/benchmark` (1.3) reveals competitive approaches; `/style` (1.1) establishes style direction.

#### Phase 4: Prototype

**Goal**: Build quick, disposable representations to test ideas — not ship-ready code.

**Methods**:

- **Paper prototypes** — Sketch on paper, test with users pointing at elements
- **Wireframes** — Low-fidelity digital layouts showing structure without style
- **Interactive prototypes** — Clickable mockups (Figma, code) testing specific flows
- **Wizard of Oz** — Human simulates AI/backend behavior to test the interface layer
- **A/B prototypes** — Build 2 versions of a critical interaction to test with users

**Key principle**: Prototypes are questions, not answers. Build them to learn, then throw them away.

**In terminal workflow**: Use AI to rapidly generate 2-3 variations of a component or screen. Treat these as prototypes to evaluate, not production code.

**Design Ops mapping**: `/screen` (4.2) and `/component` (4.3) generate prototypes; `/tokens` (4.1) establishes the design foundation.

### Macro Stage 3: MATERIALIZE (Test + Implement)

Validate with real users and ship with confidence.

#### Phase 5: Test

**Goal**: Evaluate prototypes with real users to identify problems before shipping.

**Methods**:

- **Usability testing** — 5 users, think-aloud protocol, task-based scenarios
- **Heuristic evaluation** — Expert review against Nielsen's 10 heuristics
- **Cognitive walkthrough** — Step through tasks from the user's perspective, checking learnability
- **A/B testing** — Statistical comparison of design variants with real traffic
- **Accessibility audit** — WCAG 2.2 compliance, screen reader testing, keyboard navigation
- **Analytics review** — Behavioral data revealing where users struggle

**Key principle**: Testing is not validation — it's learning. The goal is to find problems, not prove your design works.

**In terminal workflow**: After AI generates UI, run Design Ops audits before deploying. Each audit simulates expert evaluation.

**Design Ops mapping**: `/audit` (2.1) heuristic evaluation; `/audit` (2.2) cognitive audit; `/a11y` (2.3) accessibility; `/audit` (2.4) journey audit; `/audit` (3.1) ethics; `/roast` (5.1) critique; `/grade` (5.3) comprehensive review.

#### Phase 6: Implement

**Goal**: Ship the validated design with production quality, accessibility, and performance.

**Methods**:

- **Design system consumption** — Build with tokens, not magic numbers
- **Component library** — Reusable, tested, accessible components
- **Progressive enhancement** — Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Performance budgets** — Time-to-interactive targets, bundle size limits
- **Monitoring** — Post-launch metrics tracking against success criteria

**Key principle**: Implementation is not "coding the design." It's translating design intent into technical reality while preserving every UX decision.

**In terminal workflow**: Use Design Ops BUILD commands with full context from earlier phases.

**Design Ops mapping**: `/tokens` (4.1) tokens; `/screen` (4.2) screens; `/component` (4.3) components; `/onboard` (4.4) onboarding; `/figma` (4.5) Figma pipeline.

### How Design Ops' 6 Phases Map to NNG

| NNG Phase | NNG Stage   | Design Ops Phase                                       | Design Ops Commands                                                              |

| Empathize | Understand  | Phase 0: GROUND                                        | `/design-ops` (0.1), `/brief` (0.2)                                              |
| Define    | Understand  | Phase 0: GROUND                                        | `/brief` (0.2)                                                                   |
| Ideate    | Explore     | Phase 1: DISCOVER                                      | `/style` (1.1), `/style` (1.2), `/benchmark` (1.3), `/research` (1.4)            |
| Prototype | Explore     | Phase 4: BUILD                                         | `/tokens` (4.1), `/screen` (4.2), `/component` (4.3)                             |
| Test      | Materialize | Phase 2: DIAGNOSE + Phase 3: FORTIFY + Phase 5: LAUNCH | `/audit`, `/audit`, `/a11y`, `/audit`, `/audit`, `/ai-audit`, `/roast`, `/grade` |
| Implement | Materialize | Phase 4: BUILD                                         | `/component` (4.3), `/onboard` (4.4), `/figma` (4.5)                             |

Note: Design Ops' phases don't map 1:1 to NNG because Design Ops is iterative — you may prototype (BUILD) before you test (DIAGNOSE), then loop back. The NNG framework provides the _thinking_, Design Ops provides the _doing_.

## The Vibe Coder's Process Bridge

### The Three Risks of Skipping Process

Research (arXiv:2509.10652) identifies three concrete risks when developers use AI to generate UI without UX process:

1. **Pseudo-productivity** — Shipping more features faster while solving fewer real problems. 10 AI-generated screens vs. 1 well-researched screen: the latter wins.

2. **Homogenization** — AI-generated UIs converge on similar patterns, creating a sameness that erodes brand differentiation and fails edge cases.

3. **Skill erosion** — Developers who always accept AI suggestions lose the ability to evaluate, critique, and improve design independently.

### The Process Bridge: Before / While / After

The bridge doesn't require abandoning AI-assisted development. It adds process _around_ the AI interaction.

#### BEFORE Prompting (2 minutes)

The pre-prompt checklist prevents the three risks by forcing human judgment before AI generation:

```markdown
## Pre-Prompt Checklist (2 min)

- [ ] Who is the user? (name a specific persona, not "users")
- [ ] What task are they completing? (verb + noun, e.g., "booking a flight")
- [ ] What's their current workaround? (how they solve this today)
- [ ] What's the success metric? (how you'll know this works)
- [ ] What platform/context? (device, environment, accessibility needs)
```

#### WHILE Generating (ongoing)

Evaluate AI output against UX principles in real-time:

```markdown
## Generation Evaluation

- Does this match the user's mental model, or the AI's training data?
- Is this solving the defined problem, or a different one?
- Would this look identical from a different AI? (homogenization check)
- Does this handle edge cases? (empty, error, loading, offline, first-use)
- Is the information hierarchy correct? (most important → least important)
```

#### AFTER Generating (5 minutes)

Post-generation audit catches the issues AI-generated UI consistently misses:

```markdown
## Post-Generation Audit (5 min)

- [ ] Run `/audit` — catches heuristic violations
- [ ] Run `/a11y` — catches accessibility gaps
- [ ] Check: does this UI work for the persona defined in BEFORE?
- [ ] Check: does this UI handle all 7 states? (empty, loading, populated, error, partial, offline, updating)
- [ ] Check: would you ship this if you couldn't use AI to generate more?
```

> **Deep dive**: See `references/vibe-coder-ux-bridge.md` for the complete bridge framework with anti-patterns, examples, and the 15-minute full UX check.

## Academic Foundations

### ISO 9241-210: Human-Centred Design

The international standard for human-centred design (2019 revision) defines six principles:

1. **The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments**
2. **Users are involved throughout design and development**
3. **The design is driven and refined by user-centred evaluation**
4. **The process is iterative**
5. **The design addresses the whole user experience**
6. **The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives**

Every Design Ops phase maps to at least one ISO 9241-210 principle. Phase 0 GROUND addresses principles 1 and 2 directly.

### Don Norman's 7 Fundamental Design Principles

From _The Design of Everyday Things_ (2013 revised edition):

| Principle            | Definition                                                      | Process Implication                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Discoverability**  | Is it possible to figure out what actions are possible?         | Test with unfamiliar users                       |
| **Feedback**         | Is there full and continuous information about results?         | Define expected system responses in Design phase |
| **Conceptual model** | Does the design project clear understanding of the system?      | Empathize to understand user mental models       |
| **Affordances**      | What actions are possible?                                      | Map affordances to user tasks, not features      |
| **Signifiers**       | Where should actions take place?                                | Test that signifiers match affordances           |
| **Mapping**          | Is there a clear relationship between controls and effects?     | Prototype to verify spatial/logical mapping      |
| **Constraints**      | Are there physical, logical, semantic, or cultural constraints? | Define constraints during problem definition     |

### Cognitive Laws That Explain Why Process Matters

| Law                            | What It Says                                                              | Why Process Prevents Violation                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hick's Law**                 | Decision time increases with number and complexity of choices             | Define phase constrains the solution space        |
| **Fitts's Law**                | Time to target depends on distance and size                               | Prototyping reveals sizing/placement issues       |
| **Miller's Law**               | Working memory holds 7±2 chunks                                           | Empathy reveals users' actual cognitive capacity  |
| **Jakob's Law**                | Users spend most time on other sites — they expect yours to work the same | Ideation includes competitive analysis            |
| **Doherty Threshold**          | Productivity soars when response time < 400ms                             | Testing phase measures actual performance         |
| **Peak-End Rule**              | Users judge experiences by the peak and end moments                       | Define phase identifies emotional moments         |
| **Von Restorff Effect**        | Distinctive items are more likely to be remembered                        | Ideation explores visual hierarchy options        |
| **Aesthetic-Usability Effect** | Attractive things are perceived as more usable                            | Style direction (Phase 1) matters before building |

## Process-to-Design-Ops Command Mapping

The mapping from NNG's process phases to the commands that serve them:

```
NNG UNDERSTAND ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Empathize        → /brief      Problem, persona, HMW questions
                   → /research   Interviews, surveys, usability tests
  Define           → /brief      Success criteria + constraint stack

## The Builder's Cheat Sheet

Quick-reference for builders who want process without theory:

### I have 2 minutes

Run `/brief` on whatever you're about to build. Just the problem statement. That's it.

### I have 10 minutes

`/design-ops` → `/brief` → then build with the constraint stack pasted into your prompt.

### I have 30 minutes

`/brief` → `/style` → `/tokens` → then build. You now have a defined problem, visual direction, and token system.

### I have 2 hours

Full Phase 0→5 journey. `/design-ops` → `/brief` → `/style` → `/style` → `/tokens` → `/screen` → `/component` → `/audit` → `/a11y` → `/roast`. This is what real design teams do.

### I have a real product to ship

Follow the full 22-step journey via `/design-ops`. Run every audit. Loop `/roast` → `/remix` → `/roast` until all scores are 7+. This is how Stripe, Linear, and Notion work.

### The one non-negotiable

Whatever your time budget: **run `/audit` + `/a11y` before shipping**. 5 minutes. Zero excuses.
