# Micro-Copy Intelligence

## Why Microcopy Matters

Microcopy is the most underestimated layer of product design. A single word on a button can change conversion by 30%. A poorly written error message causes support tickets. A delightful empty state turns a dead-end into activation. A confusing permission request tanks opt-in rates.

Most products fail at microcopy not because the words are "wrong" but because they are written by developers in a rush, never reviewed by a writer, and never tested with users. The result: vague buttons ("Submit"), hostile errors ("Invalid input"), lifeless empty states ("No data"), and permission requests that give users no reason to say yes.

This skill gives Design Ops a production-grade microcopy library — 1000+ templates across every UI component, every state, every tone, and every major industry sector. Every template is copy-paste ready, with tone variants, character counts, accessibility notes, and i18n considerations.

## Core Principle: Clear > Clever

The single most important rule in UX writing: **clarity beats cleverness every time**. Users are not reading your interface for entertainment. They are trying to accomplish a task. Every word should reduce cognitive load, not add to it.

| Principle             | Description                                | Example                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clear > Clever        | Plain language over puns or jargon         | "Save changes" not "Commit your brilliance"                        |
| Specific > Generic    | Tell them exactly what happens             | "Delete 3 photos" not "Delete items"                               |
| Human > Robotic       | Write like a helpful person, not a machine | "We couldn't find that page" not "Error 404: Resource not located" |
| Short > Long          | Every extra word is cognitive cost         | "Saved" not "Your changes have been successfully saved"            |
| Active > Passive      | Direct the user with active voice          | "Enter your email" not "Email should be entered"                   |
| Consistent > Creative | Same action = same word everywhere         | Always "Remove" or always "Delete", never both                     |
| Helpful > Blaming     | Guide, don't accuse                        | "That password is too short" not "You entered an invalid password" |

## Voice and Tone Framework

**Voice** is your product's personality — it stays constant. **Tone** adapts to context.

### Voice Spectrum (Pick Your Position)

```
Formal ←————————————————→ Casual
  |                           |
  Banking, Legal,         Social, Gaming,
  Enterprise              Consumer

Serious ←————————————————→ Playful

  Utilities, Tools        E-commerce,
  Productivity            Fitness, Social
```

### Tone Adaptation by Context

The same product shifts tone based on what the user is experiencing:

| Context                 | Tone Shift                 | Why                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Errors**              | Empathetic, calm, helpful  | User is frustrated — don't add to it                   |
| **Success**             | Warm, affirming, brief     | User accomplished something — celebrate proportionally |
| **Empty states**        | Encouraging, instructional | User sees nothing — guide them to value                |
| **Destructive actions** | Cautious, specific, clear  | High stakes — no ambiguity allowed                     |
| **Onboarding**          | Welcoming, motivating      | First impressions — build confidence                   |
| **Loading/waiting**     | Light, reassuring          | User is stuck — ease anxiety                           |
| **Permission requests** | Transparent, benefit-led   | User must trust you — explain why                      |
| **Pricing/payment**     | Trustworthy, precise       | Money is involved — no vagueness                       |
| **Legal/compliance**    | Plain, clear, accessible   | Required info — make it readable                       |

## Content Hierarchy in UI

Every UI moment has three layers of information. Not all three are always needed.

| Layer         | Purpose            | Example (File Upload)               |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Primary**   | What to do         | "Upload your photo"                 |
| **Secondary** | Why or context     | "This will be your profile picture" |
| **Tertiary**  | How or constraints | "JPG or PNG, max 5 MB"              |

**Rules:**

- Primary copy is always visible
- Secondary copy appears when context is unclear
- Tertiary copy appears on hover, in helper text, or when errors occur
- Mobile: reduce to primary + tertiary (space is precious)

## The Microcopy Formula

For any UI element, apply this structure:

```
[Action Verb] + [Object] + [Benefit/Context]
```

**Examples:**

- "Save changes" = action + object
- "Upload photo to complete your profile" = action + object + benefit
- "Delete this project permanently" = action + object + context
- "Invite teammates to collaborate" = action + object + benefit

**When to add benefit/context:**

- The action is unfamiliar (onboarding)
- The action is irreversible (destructive)
- The action requires trust (permissions, payments)
- The action has a non-obvious outcome

## Readability Scoring for UI

Target readability for UI text:

| Component                 | Flesch-Kincaid Grade | Max Words | Max Characters |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Button label              | Grade 3-5            | 1-4       | 25             |

| Empty state body          | Grade 5-8            | 10-30     | 180            |
| Toast message             | Grade 4-6            | 3-10      | 60             |
| Notification title        | Grade 4-6            | 3-10      | 65             |
| Notification body         | Grade 5-7            | 10-25     | 150            |

| Onboarding body           | Grade 5-7            | 15-40     | 250            |
| Helper text               | Grade 5-7            | 5-15      | 100            |
| Confirmation dialog title | Grade 4-6            | 3-8       | 50             |
| Confirmation dialog body  | Grade 5-7            | 10-30     | 180            |
| Permission request body   | Grade 5-7            | 15-35     | 200            |
| Loading message           | Grade 3-5            | 2-8       | 50             |

**Testing readability:** Paste your copy into Hemingway Editor or use the Flesch-Kincaid formula. If a 12-year-old cannot understand it instantly, rewrite it.

## Inclusive Language Checklist

Before shipping any microcopy:

- [ ] **Gender-neutral:** "They" not "he/she". "Spouse" not "husband/wife". "Parent" not "mother/father" (unless context-specific).
- [ ] **Ability-neutral:** "Select" not "Click". "View" not "See". "Enter" not "Type". Avoid "simple", "easy", "just" (what is easy for you may not be for them).
- [ ] **Age-neutral:** Avoid generational slang. "Download" not "Yeet this to your device".
- [ ] **Culture-neutral:** Avoid idioms that do not translate ("break a leg", "piece of cake"). No sports metaphors as primary copy.
- [ ] **Jargon-free:** "Sign in" not "Authenticate". "Save" not "Persist". "Error" not "Exception".
- [ ] **No assumptions:** Do not assume family structure, location, device, connection speed, or technical literacy.
- [ ] **Respectful defaults:** "Preferred name" not "Nickname". "Phone number (optional)" not "Mobile number (required)".
- [ ] **Error messages blame the system, not the user:** "We couldn't process that" not "You made an error".

## i18n Considerations for Microcopy

Microcopy that works in English may break in translation. Plan ahead:

### Text Expansion

| Language   | Expansion vs. English                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| German     | +30-35%                                     |
| French     | +15-20%                                     |
| Spanish    | +20-25%                                     |
| Italian    | +15-20%                                     |
| Portuguese | +20-30%                                     |
| Russian    | +15-20%                                     |
| Japanese   | -10-20% (character count, but wider glyphs) |
| Chinese    | -20-30% (character count)                   |
| Arabic     | +20-25% (plus RTL layout)                   |
| Korean     | -10-15%                                     |

**Rules:**

- Buttons: Allow 40% extra width or use auto-sizing
- Tooltips: Max 60% of container width in English to allow expansion
- Never hard-code string widths
- Test with German and Arabic (longest expansion + RTL)

### Cultural Sensitivity

- **Humor:** Puns and wordplay rarely translate. Stick to clear language.
- **Formality:** German, Japanese, Korean require formal register by default. "Du" vs "Sie" in German matters enormously.
- **Color of language:** "Red" means danger in the West, luck in China. Do not rely on color words alone.
- **Dates and numbers:** "1/2/2026" is January 2 (US) or February 1 (most of the world). Use explicit formats.
- **Names:** Not everyone has a first + last name structure. "Full name" is safer than "First name / Last name".
- **Icons with text:** Thumbs-up is offensive in parts of the Middle East. Always pair icons with text labels.

### String Externalization

- Every user-facing string must be in a localization file, never hard-coded
- Use ICU MessageFormat for plurals: `{count, plural, one {# item} other {# items}}`
- Avoid string concatenation: `"Welcome, " + name + "!"` breaks in languages with different word order
- Use full sentences as translation units, not fragments

## How to Use This Skill

### Quick Lookup

"I need a button label for [action]" — Go to `button-label-templates.md`, find the action type, pick the tone variant that matches your product voice.

### Full Screen Copy

"I'm designing a [screen type] and need all the copy" — Combine templates from multiple reference files: buttons from `button-label-templates.md`, errors from `error-success-messages.md`, empty states from `empty-state-copy.md`, tooltips from `notification-tooltip-copy.md`.

### Tone Calibration

"My product is a [sector] app with a [formal/casual] voice" — Use the Sector Tone Guides above to set your voice, then filter all templates through that tone.

### Copy Audit

"Review my existing copy for quality" — Check against the principles (Clear > Clever), readability scores, inclusive language checklist, and anti-patterns in each reference file.

### i18n Preparation

"We're localizing to [language]" — Check text expansion ratios, review cultural sensitivity notes, verify string externalization patterns.

## Quality Checklist for Any Microcopy

Before shipping any piece of UI text, verify:

- [ ] Is it clear on first read? (No re-reading needed)
- [ ] Is it specific? (User knows exactly what will happen)
- [ ] Is it actionable? (User knows what to do next)
- [ ] Is it consistent? (Same terms used across the product)
- [ ] Is it concise? (No unnecessary words)
- [ ] Is it inclusive? (No gendered, ableist, or culturally specific language)
- [ ] Is it translatable? (No idioms, puns, concatenated strings)
- [ ] Is it accessible? (Works with screen readers, announced properly)
- [ ] Does it match the product voice? (Tone is appropriate for context)
- [ ] Is it tested? (Real users understood it without explanation)

## Microcopy Decision Tree

```
User encounters UI element
  |
  +-- Is it an action? (button, link, CTA)
  |     -> button-label-templates.md
  |
  +-- Is something wrong? (error, failure, warning)
  |     -> error-success-messages.md (error section)
  |
  +-- Did something succeed? (confirmation, completion)
  |     -> error-success-messages.md (success section)
  |
  +-- Is it empty? (no content, no results, first use)
  |     -> empty-state-copy.md
  |
  +-- Is it onboarding? (first launch, feature tour, setup)
  |     -> onboarding-permission-copy.md
  |
  +-- Is it asking permission? (notifications, camera, location)
  |     -> onboarding-permission-copy.md (permissions section)
  |
  +-- Is it contextual help? (tooltip, helper text, hint)
  |     -> notification-tooltip-copy.md
  |
  +-- Is it a notification? (push, in-app, toast)
  |     -> notification-tooltip-copy.md
  |
  +-- Is it a confirmation? (delete, cancel, destructive)
  |     -> notification-tooltip-copy.md (confirmation section)
```

## Writing Microcopy: Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the moment.** What is the user doing right now? What just happened? What emotional state are they likely in?
2. **Determine the goal.** What do you need the user to understand or do next?
3. **Pick the tone.** Use the tone adaptation table — match the context, not your default voice.
4. **Draft with the formula.** [Action] + [Object] + [Benefit/Context] as needed.
5. **Cut ruthlessly.** Remove every word that is not doing work. Read it aloud — if you stumble, simplify.
6. **Check the checklist.** Inclusive? Translatable? Accessible? Consistent? Specific?
7. **Test with real users.** Show it out of context — can they tell what it means? Show it in context — do they do the right thing?

## Accessibility Requirements for Microcopy

- **ARIA live regions:** Error messages and success confirmations must be announced to screen readers via `aria-live="polite"` (success) or `aria-live="assertive"` (errors).
- **Error association:** Every error message must be programmatically associated with its input via `aria-describedby`.
- **Button labels:** If a button uses only an icon, provide `aria-label` with the full text label.
- **Tooltip accessibility:** Tooltips must be reachable via keyboard (focus, not just hover) and announced by screen readers.
- **Loading announcements:** Announce loading start and completion to screen readers.
- **Confirmation dialogs:** Focus must move to the dialog when it opens and return to the trigger when it closes.
- **Status messages:** Use `role="status"` for non-critical updates and `role="alert"` for urgent messages.
- **No time pressure:** If a toast auto-dismisses, the information must be available elsewhere (notification center, status area).
