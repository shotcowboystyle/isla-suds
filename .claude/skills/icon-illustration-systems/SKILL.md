# Icon and Illustration Systems

## Mental model

An icon is a compression of meaning, and compression only works when the reader
already has the key. Most icon failures are the designer assuming a metaphor is
universal when it is learned.

- **Universal metaphors are a short list.** Home, search, close, play, plus,
  trash, settings, back. Everything else is learned, and learned means a label.
- **If you have to debate whether an icon is self-explanatory, add a label.**
  The debate is the evidence. Icon-only navigation measurably reduces
  discoverability; icon-plus-label costs a few pixels and removes the problem.
- **Optical alignment beats mathematical alignment.** A triangle centred by
  bounding box looks off-centre. Centre by visual mass, which for a play glyph
  means nudging right.
- **One grid, one stroke weight, one corner radius.** Mixing icon sets is the
  fastest way to make an interface look assembled rather than designed.
- **Decorative icons are invisible to screen readers, meaningful ones are not.**
  That distinction is a decision you make per icon, not a default.

## Constants

Every recipe in the reference files emits these.


| Token | Size | Line Height | Use Cases | Touch Target |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| `icon-xs` | 12px | 12px | Status dots, inline indicators, badge counts, color swatches | N/A (not interactive) |
| `icon-sm` | 16px | 16px | Inline with small text (12-13px), table row icons, tag icons, breadcrumb separators | 24x24px min |
| `icon-md` | 20px | 20px | Default size — nav items, buttons, form field icons, list item icons, dropdown arrows | 32x32px min |
| `icon-lg` | 24px | 24px | Prominent actions, card header icons, section markers, tab bar icons (mobile) | 44x44px min (mobile) |
| `icon-xl` | 32px | 32px | Feature icons, section headers, sidebar category icons, dialog icons | 44x44px min |
| `icon-2xl` | 40px | 40px | Hero feature icons, onboarding step icons, empty state accents | N/A (usually decorative) |
| `icon-3xl` | 48px | 48px | Large empty state illustrations, marketing feature blocks, landing page icons | N/A (usually decorative) |

### Sizing Rules
- Icons below 16px should use simplified glyphs (fewer details, thicker relative strokes)
- Icons at 12px may need to be redesigned as filled shapes rather than stroked outlines
- At 32px+, icons can support more detail (inner strokes, secondary elements)
- Never scale a 24px icon down to 12px by setting width/height — use a dedicated small variant
- Design at 24px, then create size-specific variants for 16px and 12px

## 4. Icon Design Rules


| State | Opacity | Color Token | Transform | Cursor | Additional |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Default** | 100% | `--icon-default` (gray-600) | none | default | — |
| **Hover** | 100% | `--icon-hover` (gray-900) | none | pointer | transition: color 150ms ease |
| **Active / Pressed** | 100% | `--icon-active` (primary-600) | scale(0.95) | pointer | transition: transform 100ms ease |
| **Disabled** | 38% | `--icon-disabled` (gray-400) | none | not-allowed | pointer-events: none |
| **Selected / On** | 100% | `--icon-selected` (primary-600) | none | pointer | Switch to filled variant if available |
| **Focus-visible** | 100% | `--icon-focus` (gray-900) | none | pointer | 2px focus ring offset 2px |
| **Drag** | 80% | `--icon-default` | scale(1.05) | grabbing | drop-shadow for lift effect |

### State Transition CSS
```css
.icon-button {
  color: var(--icon-default);
  transition: color 150ms ease, transform 100ms ease, opacity 150ms ease;
}
.icon-button:hover { color: var(--icon-hover); }
.icon-button:active { color: var(--icon-active); transform: scale(0.95); }
.icon-button:disabled { color: var(--icon-disabled); opacity: 0.38; pointer-events: none; }
.icon-button[aria-selected="true"] { color: var(--icon-selected); }
.icon-button:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--focus-ring); outline-offset: 2px; }
```

## 8. Animated Icons

## Index

| Need | Reference |
|---|---|
| Choose an icon set (Lucide, Heroicons, Phosphor, Tabler) | `icon-library-catalog.md` |
| SF Symbols and Material Symbols conventions | `icon-library-catalog.md` |
| Licence and coverage comparison | `icon-library-catalog.md` |
| React icon component, inline vs sprite vs font | `icon-implementation-recipes.md` |
| Animated icons: spinner, toggle, hamburger morph | `icon-implementation-recipes.md` |
| SVGO config and size targets | `icon-implementation-recipes.md` |
| Choosing an illustration style | `illustration-systems.md` |
| Empty-state and spot illustrations | `illustration-systems.md` |
| The 24x24 grid, keyline shapes, safe zones | `icon-geometry-and-color.md` |
| currentColor, multi-colour icons, dark mode | `icon-geometry-and-color.md` |

## Reference architecture

| File | Covers | Lines |
|---|---|---|
| `references/icon-library-catalog.md` | 6 libraries + platform conventions | 237 |
| `references/icon-implementation-recipes.md` | component, states, animation, SVGO | 206 |
| `references/illustration-systems.md` | 16 styles, empty states, spot art | 168 |
| `references/icon-geometry-and-color.md` | grid, keylines, colour | 71 |

## What every reference file contains

1. When to reach for it, and the simpler option to try first
2. Complete code, not fragments
3. The accessibility wiring for that specific case
4. Dark-mode behaviour
5. The mistake that case invites


### Meaningful vs Decorative Icons
Every icon is either **meaningful** (conveys information) or **decorative** (visual embellishment). The treatment differs completely:

**Meaningful icons** (icon is the only way to understand the action):
```html
<!-- Method 1: aria-label on the button -->
<button aria-label="Search">
  <svg aria-hidden="true"><!-- icon --></svg>
</button>

<!-- Method 2: title element inside SVG -->
<svg role="img" aria-labelledby="search-title">
  <title id="search-title">Search</title>
  <!-- icon paths -->
</svg>

<!-- Method 3: Visually hidden text -->
<button>
  <svg aria-hidden="true"><!-- icon --></svg>
  <span class="sr-only">Search</span>
</button>
```

**Decorative icons** (icon accompanies visible text):
```html
<button>
  <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><!-- icon --></svg>
  <span>Search</span>
</button>
```

### Accessibility Rules
1. **Every icon** must have either `aria-hidden="true"` (decorative) or an accessible name (meaningful)
2. Add `focusable="false"` to inline SVGs in IE/Edge legacy to prevent tab-stop issues
3. Use `role="img"` when the SVG is meaningful and uses `<title>` for its label
4. Toggle icons must announce their state: `aria-pressed="true/false"` or `aria-expanded`
5. Icon-only buttons require a minimum 44x44px touch target (WCAG 2.5.8)
6. Color alone must not be the only indicator — pair colored icons with shape changes (e.g., filled vs outline for selected)
7. Animated icons must respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (WCAG 2.3.3)
