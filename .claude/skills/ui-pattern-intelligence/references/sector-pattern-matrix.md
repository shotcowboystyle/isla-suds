# Sector Pattern Matrix — Which Patterns Matter Most by Industry

## How This Matrix Works

Not every pattern matters equally in every sector. A fintech app without trust signals is dead on arrival. A social app without a feed is not a social app. An e-commerce store without product cards has nothing to sell.

This matrix maps each sector to its **critical patterns** (must have — users expect them), **important patterns** (should have — differentiators), **nice-to-have patterns** (add polish but aren't expected), and **anti-patterns** (patterns that actively hurt in this sector).

When Design Ops analyzes a user's app and identifies their sector, this matrix determines: what patterns are missing that should be there, what patterns are present that shouldn't be, and what the priority order is for upgrades.

## Fintech / Banking / Payments

**Users expect**: Absolute reliability, transparency, and security. Every dollar shown must be accurate. Every action must feel safe. Trust is earned per-pixel.

### Critical Patterns (must have)

| Pattern                   | Why It's Critical                                                                                       | Benchmark       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Data Table (2.1)          | Transaction history, statements, account activity — this is the product                                 | Stripe, Mercury |
| Stat/Metric Display (2.7) | Account balances, spending summaries, portfolio performance — the dashboard IS stat cards               | Mercury, Ramp   |
| Trust Signals (6.12)      | SSL badges, security messaging, encryption indicators — without trust, no one enters their bank details | Stripe, Plaid   |
| Form Inputs (3.1)         | Account numbers, transfer amounts, payment details — must be precise, validated, and smart-filled       | Stripe Elements |
| Credit Card Input (3.19)  | Brand detection, formatting, CVC — specialized financial input                                          | Stripe Elements |
| Confirmation Dialog (4.8) | "Transfer $5,000?" — every financial action must confirm with amount and recipient                      | Cash App, Wise  |
| Loading/Progress (4.4)    | "Processing payment..." — financial operations MUST show progress, never leave user uncertain           | Stripe          |
| Toast/Status (4.1)        | "Transfer complete" — immediate, unambiguous feedback for every financial action                        | Mercury         |
| Error Handling (2.21)     | "Insufficient funds" — financial errors must be clear, specific, and suggest next steps                 | Stripe          |
| Stepper/Wizard (1.10)     | Onboarding: KYC, identity verification, account setup. Must feel professional and secure                | Ramp, Mercury   |

### Important Patterns (should have)

| Pattern                   | Why                                                                    | Benchmark          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Sparkline Charts (2.4)    | Spending trends, portfolio performance, balance over time              | Mercury, Robinhood |
| Search (3.2)              | Find transactions by merchant, amount, date                            | Mercury            |
| Date Range Picker (3.7)   | Statement periods, report generation, tax date ranges                  | Stripe             |

| Badge/Status (2.5)        | Transaction status: Pending, Completed, Failed, Refunded               | Stripe             |
| Notification Center (4.3) | Large transactions, suspicious activity, payment received              | Cash App           |
| Export/Download           | CSV, PDF statement generation                                          | Mercury            |
| Multi-Factor Auth (3.16)  | OTP input for sensitive operations                                     | All fintech        |

### Anti-Patterns for Fintech

- Infinite scroll for transactions (users need pagination to find specific items)
- Gamification of spending (making money feel like a game is ethically questionable)
- Auto-advancing carousels showing financial data (user must control the pace)
- Rounded/approximate numbers (show exact cents for financial data)
- Hidden fees revealed late in checkout (trust destroyer — show all fees upfront)
- Aggressive upsell during financial operations (user is in a trust-critical mental state)
- Dark mode without sufficient contrast for financial numbers
- Motion/animation that delays showing account balances

### Visual Direction

- **Colors**: Blues, navys, whites. Green for positive (gains), red for negative (losses). Avoid loud colors.
- **Typography**: Clean, professional. Inter, SF Pro, or a humanist sans-serif. Monospace for numbers (tabular figures essential).
- **Density**: Medium-high. Financial users want information density but not clutter.
- **Motion**: Minimal and purposeful. No decorative animation. Quick, confident transitions.

## SaaS / Productivity / Project Management

**Users expect**: Speed, keyboard shortcuts, customizable workflows, and the ability to handle their specific complex workflow without fighting the tool.

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Sidebar Navigation (1.3)  | Workspaces, projects, views — the organizational spine         | Linear, Notion     |
| Command Palette (1.6)     | Power users expect Cmd+K. It's table stakes for 2025+ SaaS     | Linear, Raycast    |

| Keyboard Shortcuts (1.25) | Every primary action must have a keyboard shortcut             | Linear, Superhuman |
| Tab Navigation (1.5)      | Switching between views of the same data                       | GitHub, Stripe     |
| Toast (4.1)               | Action confirmations, save success, status changes             | Linear             |
| Empty State (2.20)        | First-run experience for every section                         | Notion             |
| Inline Editing (3.25)     | Click-to-edit for titles, descriptions, properties             | Notion, Linear     |

### Important Patterns

| Integration/Webhook UI | Connect to other tools                     | Zapier, Linear   |

### Anti-Patterns for SaaS

- No keyboard shortcuts (forces mouse dependency — power users will leave)
- No command palette (feels dated in 2025+)
- Modal-heavy workflows (modals interrupt flow — use inline editing and side panels)
- No dark mode (developers and power users expect it)
- Saving requires clicking "Save" (auto-save is expected for document-like products)
- No undo (destructive actions without undo are unacceptable)
- Cluttered sidebar with no collapse (visual noise)
- Slow search (> 200ms for local, > 500ms for remote)

### Visual Direction

- **Colors**: Neutral bases (gray, slate) with a single brand accent. Dark mode is primary or equal.
- **Typography**: Inter, system fonts, or a clean sans-serif. Monospace for code/technical content.
- **Density**: High. SaaS power users want maximum information density. Compact modes.
- **Motion**: Fast, functional. < 150ms transitions. Spring animations for drags. No decorative animation.

| Trust Signals (6.12)             | Secure checkout, return policy, shipping info                       | All e-commerce  |

### Important Patterns

| Pattern                    | Why                                                    | Benchmark           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |

| Shipping Estimator         | Delivery date estimation in cart/product page          | Amazon              |

### Anti-Patterns for E-Commerce

- No guest checkout (requiring account creation to buy is the #1 cart abandonment cause)
- Hidden shipping costs revealed at checkout (the #2 abandonment cause)
- Product images that can't be zoomed
- No reviews or ratings (trust gap — buyers rely on social proof)
- Forced upsells that block checkout completion (dark pattern)
- "Continue Shopping" button more prominent than "Checkout" (friction)
- Cart that requires a page reload to update quantities
- False scarcity/urgency (fake countdown timers, fake "only 1 left")

### Visual Direction

- **Colors**: White/light backgrounds for products to pop. Accent color for CTAs (high contrast).
- **Typography**: Clean, commercial. System fonts or a geometric sans. Price styling is critical — bold, large.
- **Density**: Medium. Enough whitespace for products to breathe, but efficient use of grid space.
- **Motion**: Smooth image transitions. Add-to-cart animation. Subtle hover effects on product cards.

## Healthcare / Wellness / Medical

**Users expect**: Clarity, accuracy, empathy, and privacy. Medical information must be unambiguous. Wellness apps must feel calm and supportive.

### Critical Patterns

| Error Prevention (form validation) | Medical data entry errors can be dangerous — validate everything                   | Epic               |
| Accessibility (all patterns)       | Healthcare must serve ALL users including elderly, disabled, cognitively impaired  | WCAG AAA target    |
| Empty State (2.20)                 | "No medications recorded" — must be supportive, not alarming                       | Apple Health       |

### Important Patterns

| Pattern               | Why                                                  | Benchmark        |

| Search (3.2)          | Find providers, medications, conditions              | Zocdoc, WebMD    |

### Anti-Patterns for Healthcare

- Gamification of health metrics (can cause unhealthy obsession)
- Bright red for all warnings (anxious patients don't need more alarm)
- Small text for critical medical information (legibility is safety)
- Auto-advancing through medical questionnaires (users need time to think)
- Social features exposing health data (privacy violation)
- Complex navigation for elderly users (simplify ruthlessly)
- Jargon without plain-language alternatives
- Notification overload (alarm fatigue is a clinical safety issue)

### Visual Direction

- **Colors**: Calming blues, greens, whites. Muted palette. Red only for critical alerts. Pastel accents.
- **Typography**: Large, readable. 16px minimum body text. High contrast (AAA preferred). Simple typeface.
- **Density**: Low-medium. Generous spacing. Large touch targets (elderly users, motor impairments).
- **Motion**: Gentle, slow. Breathing animations for wellness. No sudden movements. Respect reduced motion.

| Gesture Navigation (1.20)  | Swipe between stories, swipe to like (TikTok), swipe to delete | Instagram, TikTok      |

### Anti-Patterns for Social

- No content moderation tools (unsafe community)
- Infinite scroll with no "You're caught up" terminus (exploitative engagement)
- Dark patterns pushing engagement over user wellbeing (addictive design)
- No way to control who sees your content (privacy violation)
- Notifications for everything with no granular control (noise)
- Auto-playing video with sound (disruptive)
- No block/mute/report functionality (safety failure)
- Exposing precise follower counts (social comparison anxiety — some platforms are hiding these)

### Anti-Patterns for Education

- Punitive error feedback ("Wrong!" without explanation)
- No way to skip ahead (forced linear progression when user already knows material)
- Gamification that rewards time-spent over learning-achieved
- Paywalls on core learning content without free tier
- Complex navigation for young learners (simplify radically for K-12)
- No offline support for learning content
- Timed assessments without accommodation options (accessibility)
- Social comparison that discourages struggling learners

### Visual Direction

- **Colors**: Bright, friendly, encouraging. Warm palette. Greens for completion. Gold for achievement. Avoid institutional gray.
- **Typography**: Rounded, friendly. Large for younger audiences. Clean for professional education.
- **Density**: Low-medium. Generous spacing. Focus on one concept at a time.
- **Motion**: Celebratory. Bounce, confetti, scaling. Character animations. High personality.

## Developer Tools / DevOps / API Products

**Users expect**: Speed, precision, respect for their technical expertise, and excellent documentation.

### Critical Patterns

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Command Palette (1.6)            | Developers expect keyboard-first interaction                        | VS Code, Raycast     |
| Code Block (2.32)                | Syntax-highlighted code with copy button — the primary content type | Stripe Docs, Vercel  |
| Documentation Layout (8.1 + 5.2) | Two-column: content + code examples. Side-by-side request/response  | Stripe Docs          |
| Status Indicator (4.10)          | Build status, deployment status, API health — green/red/yellow      | Vercel, GitHub       |
| Terminal/Log Output              | Streaming build logs, deployment logs, error traces                 | Vercel, Netlify      |
| API Key Management               | Create, revoke, copy, scope permissions — secure and clear          | Stripe, Resend       |
| Search (3.2)                     | Docs search, API reference search, global search                    | Algolia-powered docs |
| Tab Navigation (1.5)             | Language switcher (JavaScript/Python/Go/cURL) in docs               | Stripe, Twilio       |
| Data Table (2.1)                 | Webhook logs, API calls, error rates                                | Stripe, Vercel       |
| Toast (4.1)                      | "Copied to clipboard", "Deployment started"                         | Vercel               |

### Anti-Patterns for Developer Tools

- No dark mode (developers live in dark mode)
- Copy buttons that don't work reliably
- Documentation search that requires exact keyword matches
- No keyboard shortcuts
- Requiring GUI clicks for tasks that should be CLI-able
- Token/key management without revocation ability
- Patronizing UX copy (developers don't need hand-holding)
- Slow dashboard (developers measure in milliseconds)

### Visual Direction

- **Colors**: Dark mode primary. Monochrome with syntax-highlighting accents. Terminal green/amber aesthetic optional.
- **Typography**: Monospace for code (JetBrains Mono, Berkeley Mono, Fira Code). Sans-serif for UI (Inter, system).
- **Density**: High. Developers want information density. Compact tables, dense logs.
- **Motion**: Minimal. Fast transitions. No decorative animation. Streaming text is the "motion."
