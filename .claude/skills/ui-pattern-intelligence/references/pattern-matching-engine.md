# Pattern Matching Engine — Analysis Protocol

## How Pattern Matching Works

When a user runs `/audit` on their codebase or provides a screenshot, Design Ops performs a systematic analysis pipeline. This file defines the exact methodology for each stage.

The pipeline has 5 stages: IDENTIFY → BENCHMARK → SECTOR-FIT → PRESCRIBE → COHERENCE.

---

## Stage 1: IDENTIFY — Map Code/Screenshots to Patterns

### Code Analysis Heuristics

When analyzing source code (React, SwiftUI, HTML/CSS, Vue, Svelte, or any component-based framework), use these heuristics to identify which patterns are present.

#### Navigation Pattern Detection

| Code Signal | Pattern Identified |
|------------|-------------------|
| `<nav>` with horizontal `<ul>` or flex row at top of page | Top Navigation Bar (1.1) |
| Fixed/sticky bottom bar with 3-5 icon+label items | Bottom Navigation Bar (1.2) |
| Vertical `<nav>` or `<aside>` with links, typically left-positioned | Sidebar Navigation (1.3) |
| Ordered list with ">" or "/" separators, ancestor links | Breadcrumbs (1.4) |
| `role="tablist"` or horizontal toggle group switching content | Tab Navigation (1.5) |
| Dialog/overlay triggered by Cmd+K or Ctrl+K with search input | Command Palette (1.6) |
| Hamburger icon (3 lines) toggling a hidden nav panel | Hamburger Menu (1.7) |
| "Previous"/"Next" buttons with page numbers | Pagination (1.8) |
| Intersection Observer or scroll event loading more content | Infinite Scroll (1.9) |
| Numbered/labeled sequential steps with Next/Back buttons | Stepper/Wizard (1.10) |

### Screenshot Analysis Protocol

When analyzing screenshots (rather than code), use visual pattern recognition:

1. **Scan top-to-bottom, left-to-right** — identify the primary layout (single column, sidebar, split, dashboard grid)
2. **Identify the navigation system** — top bar? sidebar? bottom bar? hamburger? tabs?
3. **Identify the primary content pattern** — cards? table? list? chart? form?
4. **Catalog every distinct UI element** — buttons, inputs, badges, avatars, icons, dividers
5. **Note the visual language** — colors, typography weight, spacing density, border radius, shadows
6. **Identify states visible** — are there loading states? empty states? error states? hover states?
7. **Check for patterns absent** — no search? no breadcrumbs? no status indicators? Absence is a finding.

### Output: Pattern Inventory

After identification, produce a structured inventory:

```
Pattern Inventory for [App Name]
Detected: [N] patterns across [M] categories

Navigation:
  - Top Nav Bar (1.1) — found in: Header.tsx
  - Sidebar (1.3) — found in: Sidebar.tsx
  - Breadcrumbs (1.4) — NOT FOUND (expected for this app type)

Data Display:
  - Cards (2.2) — found in: ProjectCard.tsx, TaskCard.tsx
  - Data Table (2.1) — found in: UserTable.tsx
  - Skeleton (2.22) — NOT FOUND (loading states missing)

[...continue for all 10 categories]
```

---

## Stage 2: BENCHMARK — Score Each Pattern

For every pattern identified in Stage 1, score its execution quality against the benchmark products from `designer-benchmark-dna.md`.

### Scoring Dimensions (per pattern)

| Dimension | Weight | What to Evaluate |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **States coverage** | 25% | Does the pattern handle all applicable states? (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, success, skeleton, empty) |
| **Accessibility** | 20% | ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader support, color contrast |
| **Visual execution** | 20% | Typography, spacing, color, hierarchy, consistency with the rest of the app |
| **Responsiveness** | 15% | Does it adapt to mobile, tablet, desktop? Touch targets on mobile? |
| **Motion & feedback** | 10% | Transitions, micro-interactions, loading feedback, state change animations |
| **Pattern correctness** | 10% | Does it follow the canonical pattern or deviate in confusing ways? |

### Scoring Scale

| Score | Label | Characteristics |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Broken | Missing critical functionality. Anti-pattern territory. Would confuse or block users. |
| 3-4 | Weak | Pattern recognizable but significant issues. Missing states, no accessibility, inconsistent styling. |
| 5-6 | Functional | Works but generic. Default framework output. No polish, no states beyond default, basic or no accessibility. This is where most vibe-coded apps land. |
| 7-8 | Good | Well-executed. Multiple states, keyboard accessible, visually polished, responsive. Minor gaps. |
| 9-10 | World-class | Benchmark-quality. All states. Full accessibility. Refined motion. Responsive. Delightful details. |

### Scoring Protocol

For each detected pattern:

1. **Identify the benchmark**: Which Tier 1/2 product sets the standard for this pattern? (Use `designer-benchmark-dna.md`)
2. **Check states**: Count how many of the applicable states are implemented vs. expected
3. **Check accessibility**: Are ARIA attributes present? Is keyboard navigation working? Is focus managed?
4. **Check visual quality**: Is the typography, spacing, and color consistent and intentional?
5. **Check responsiveness**: Does it work across breakpoints?
6. **Check motion**: Are there transitions? Loading feedback? State change animations?
7. **Calculate weighted score**: Apply dimension weights
8. **Generate gap analysis**: What specific changes would increase the score?

### Output: Benchmark Scorecard

```
Pattern Benchmark Scores

| Pattern | Score | Benchmark Target | Gap |
|---------|-------|-----------------|-----|
| Top Nav (1.1) | 6/10 | Linear 9/10 | Missing: keyboard shortcuts, active state, responsive collapse |
| Cards (2.2) | 5/10 | Airbnb 10/10 | Missing: hover state, loading skeleton, consistent heights |
| Data Table (2.1) | 7/10 | Stripe 10/10 | Missing: empty state, column resize, sticky header |
| Search (3.2) | 4/10 | Algolia 10/10 | Missing: instant results, recent searches, keyboard navigation |

Overall Pattern Quality: 5.5/10
Patterns at benchmark: 0/[N]
Patterns needing work: [N]
Anti-patterns detected: [N]
```

## Stage 3: SECTOR-FIT — Cross-Reference Against Sector Expectations

Using the `sector-pattern-matrix.md`, evaluate whether the app has the right patterns for its sector.

### Analysis Protocol

1. **Identify the sector** (from user input or auto-detected from code/content):
   - Look for domain-specific terms, data models, or imports
   - Payment/banking terms → Fintech
   - Product/cart/checkout terms → E-commerce
   - Patient/health/medical terms → Healthcare
   - Lesson/course/quiz terms → Education
   - Post/feed/follow terms → Social
   - If ambiguous, ask the user

2. **Pull the sector's critical pattern list** from the sector matrix

3. **Cross-reference**:
   - **Present + Critical**: Good — verify execution quality
   - **Present + Not Expected**: Investigate — is this a deliberate choice or accidental?
   - **Missing + Critical**: Flag as HIGH priority — this is expected for the sector
   - **Missing + Important**: Flag as MEDIUM priority — would improve the product
   - **Anti-pattern for sector**: Flag as URGENT — this actively hurts in this sector

4. **Sector visual alignment**: Does the visual direction (colors, typography, density, motion) match sector expectations?

### Output: Sector Fit Report

```
Sector: [Detected/Specified]
Critical Pattern Coverage: [X/Y] (Z%)

MISSING CRITICAL:
  - Trust Signals (6.12) — Expected for fintech, not found
  - Error Handling (2.21) — Financial apps must have clear error states

MISSING IMPORTANT:
  - Sparkline Charts (2.4) — Expected for financial dashboards

PRESENT BUT UNEXPECTED:
  - Gamification (9.10) — Unusual for fintech, verify this is intentional

SECTOR ANTI-PATTERNS DETECTED:
  - Infinite scroll on transaction list (fintech anti-pattern — use pagination)

VISUAL DIRECTION ALIGNMENT:
  - Colors: [Aligned / Misaligned — details]
  - Typography: [Aligned / Misaligned — details]
  - Density: [Aligned / Misaligned — details]
```

## Stage 4: PRESCRIBE — Specific Upgrade Recommendations

For every pattern scored below 7/10, and every missing critical/important pattern, generate a specific upgrade prescription.

### Prescription Format

For each finding:

```
UPGRADE: [Pattern Name] ([Current Score] → [Target Score])

WHAT'S WRONG:
  [Specific issues identified in the current implementation]

WHAT WORLD-CLASS LOOKS LIKE:
  [Reference product] does it this way: [specific description]
  [Why it works]: [Cognitive/UX principle]

HOW TO FIX:
  Priority 1: [Most impactful change — describe specifically]
  Priority 2: [Second change]
  Priority 3: [Third change]

EFFORT ESTIMATE:
  [Quick win: < 1hr | Medium: 1-4hr | Large: 4hr+ | Strategic: days]

PRINCIPLES APPLIED:
  - [Law/Heuristic]: [How it applies]
  - [Law/Heuristic]: [How it applies]
```

### Prescription Prioritization

Rank all prescriptions by impact × effort:

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **P0 — Fix Now** | Anti-patterns or broken patterns that actively hurt usability. Missing critical sector patterns. Accessibility failures. |
| **P1 — High Impact** | Patterns scoring 3-5 that are core to the product. Missing important patterns. Quick wins that dramatically improve quality. |
| **P2 — Polish** | Patterns scoring 5-7 that could be elevated to good. Missing motion, missing states. |
| **P3 — Delight** | Patterns scoring 7-8 that could reach world-class. Advanced animation, micro-interactions, edge case handling. |

### Linking to Design Ops Commands

Every prescription should link to the Design Ops command that can execute the fix:

| Fix Type | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Build a new component | `/ship [component]` |
| Build a new screen | `/screen [screen type]` |
| Create design tokens | `/tokens` |
| Fix accessibility issues | `/a11y` |
| Improve content/copy | `/audit` |
| Redesign a pattern | `/remix` |
| Verify the fix | `/roast` or `/audit` |

---

## Stage 5: COHERENCE — Visual Language Assessment

The final check: do all the patterns used form a coherent visual language, or does the app feel like a Frankenstein of copied patterns from different sources?

### Coherence Dimensions

| Dimension | What to Check |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Color consistency** | Is the same palette used throughout? Are semantic colors (success, error, warning) consistent? |
| **Typography consistency** | Same typeface family? Consistent scale? Consistent weight usage? |
| **Spacing consistency** | Same base grid (4px, 8px)? Consistent padding within similar elements? |
| **Border radius consistency** | Same radius values across cards, inputs, buttons, badges? |
| **Shadow/elevation consistency** | Same shadow system? Consistent elevation levels? |
| **Icon style consistency** | Same icon set? Same stroke weight? Same fill style? |
| **Motion consistency** | Same easing curves? Same duration ranges? Same interaction patterns? |
| **Density consistency** | Same information density across screens? Or jarring shifts between dense and sparse? |
| **Pattern language consistency** | Do similar actions use similar patterns? (e.g., all destructive actions are red buttons, all navigation is in the sidebar) |

### Coherence Scoring

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1-3 | **Incoherent** | Frankenstein UI. Multiple design systems mixed. No consistent visual language. Common in vibe-coded apps that pull from multiple prompts or templates. |
| 4-5 | **Fragmented** | Some consistency but notable breaks. Maybe the dashboard uses one style and settings uses another. Or cards and tables have different spacing systems. |
| 6-7 | **Mostly coherent** | Clear visual language with occasional breaks. Perhaps one component was added later and doesn't match, or dark mode has inconsistencies. |
| 8-9 | **Unified** | Strong design system. Consistent across all screens. Minor edge cases might deviate. |
| 10 | **Systematic** | Design token-driven. Every value traces to a token. Every pattern follows the system. Design system maturity level 4-5. |

### Coherence Fix Protocol

If coherence < 7:

1. **Identify the dominant style** — which screens/components represent the "intended" design language?
2. **Identify outliers** — which components break from the dominant style?
3. **Recommend token extraction** → `/tokens` to formalize the visual language into W3C design tokens
4. **Recommend component rebuilding** → `/component` to rebuild outlier components using the token system
5. **Recommend audit** → `/grade` to verify coherence after fixes
