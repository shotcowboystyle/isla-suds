# Emerging Patterns 2025-2026 — The Cutting Edge

## How to Use This File

This file catalogs 50+ patterns that are emerging, growing, or reaching mainstream adoption in 2025-2026. Unlike the stable patterns in `pattern-taxonomy-complete.md`, these patterns are in flux — their canonical form is still being established. When Design Ops recommends emerging patterns, it should note the adoption status and implementation complexity so users can make informed decisions about whether to adopt early.

Each entry includes: what it is, adoption status, implementation complexity, reference apps, and basic specs.

Adoption status levels:

- **Emerging** — Pioneered by 1-3 products, not yet widely adopted. High risk, high differentiation.
- **Growing** — Adopted by 10+ notable products, patterns solidifying. Moderate risk, good differentiation.
- **Mainstream** — Widely adopted, canonical form established. Low risk, expected by users.

Implementation complexity:

- **Low** — Can be built with standard UI libraries and components.
- **Medium** — Requires specialized libraries, custom components, or non-trivial architecture.
- **High** — Requires significant infrastructure (real-time sync, ML models, spatial computing SDKs).

## Implementation Priority Matrix

For teams deciding which emerging patterns to adopt:

**Adopt Now (low risk, high value):**

- Command palette (proven pattern, easy to add)
- Skeleton loading (replaces spinners, trivial swap)
- Block editor (Notion proved the model, libraries available)
- Keyboard shortcuts (incremental, always beneficial)
- AI content suggestions (APIs available, clear value)

**Adopt Soon (moderate risk, high value):**

- AI Chat Sidebar (well-understood pattern, API costs are the main barrier)
- Multiplayer cursors (libraries like Liveblocks make it accessible)
- Offline-first (investment pays off in reliability and UX)
- Glanceable widgets (platform APIs are mature)

**Watch and Evaluate (high risk/investment, high potential):**

- AI Generated UI (early, no canonical form yet)
- Spatial widgets (hardware dependency, small user base)
- Live shopping (market-dependent, high infrastructure cost)
- AR try-on (impressive but expensive to implement well)
- Crypto payments (volatile adoption, regulatory complexity)

**Experimental Only (cutting edge, niche):**

- Radial menus (spatial computing only, niche desktop)
- Custom gestures (discoverability challenge)
- Voice-only interfaces (accuracy still inconsistent)
- Spatial navigation (hardware-dependent)
