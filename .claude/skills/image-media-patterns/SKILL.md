# Image & Media Patterns — Complete Visual Media System

## Mental model

Media is where performance and craft collide. An unoptimised hero image costs
more than every font, script and stylesheet on the page combined, and a
correctly-sized one is invisible.

- **Reserve the space.** Width and height attributes or `aspect-ratio` on every
  image. Layout shift is the single most common Core Web Vitals failure and the
  easiest to prevent.
- **The hero is never lazy.** `loading="lazy"` on the largest contentful paint
  element delays the thing the score is measuring. Lazy-load everything below
  the fold and nothing above it.
- **Aspect ratio is a design decision.** 16:9 for video, 4:3 for editorial, 1:1
  for avatars and grids, 3:2 for photography. Mixing ratios inside one grid
  reads as an accident.
- **Autoplay needs muting, a pause control, and a reduced-motion escape.** All
  three, not two.
- **Alt text describes function, not appearance.** A decorative image takes
  `alt=""`; a linked image describes the destination.

| `references/gallery-carousel-patterns.md` | 13 gallery and carousel patterns | 1244 |

## What every reference file contains

1. When the pattern applies, and the simpler thing to try first
2. Complete HTML/CSS/TSX with the loading strategy included
3. Accessibility: alt text rules, controls, keyboard, reduced motion
4. The performance cost and how to measure it
5. The mobile form of the pattern

## Routing

For **galleries and carousels** — masonry (both CSS-columns and grid), justified,
uniform and mosaic grids, lightboxes, scroll-snap and autoplay carousels,
filmstrips, infinite scroll and comparison sliders: read
`references/gallery-carousel-patterns.md`.

For **players** — a complete custom video player spec, scroll-triggered
picture-in-picture, full audio player, podcast player, and voice-message UI:
read `references/media-player-patterns.md`.

For **shipping images well** — width- and DPR-based `srcset`, art direction with
`<picture>`, native and IntersectionObserver lazy loading, LQIP, BlurHash,
ThumbHash and dominant-color placeholders: read
`references/responsive-image-recipes.md`.

For **odds and ends** — the patterns that had no home in the files above when this skill was converted to a router: read `references/media-supplementary.md`.
