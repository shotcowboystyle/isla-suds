## 1. Stitch MCP (Google)

### Purpose

Generate complete UI screens, multi-page sites, and design systems from text descriptions. Stitch understands design context (colors, typography, layout patterns) and produces HTML/CSS output that can be previewed, iterated, and converted to production code.

### MCP Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stitch": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/stitch-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

- `extract_components` (boolean, default true): Extract component patterns

**Returns:** A design context object that can be passed to `generate_screen_from_text` for style-consistent generation.

**When to use:** Before generating screens for an existing product, or when the user wants to match a reference design's style.

#### `generate_screen_from_text`

Generates a complete screen from a text description, optionally using design context for style consistency.

**Parameters:**

- `description` (string, required): Detailed description of the screen to generate

## MCP Detection Protocol

When Design Ops runs a generation command, follow this protocol:

### Step 1: Detect Available MCP Servers

Check which MCP servers are connected in the current session. The available tools will indicate which servers are active.

### Step 2: Route to Best Available Tool

Using the Tool Selection Matrix above, identify the best tool for the task. If the best tool is not available, use the fallback.

### Step 3: Handle No-MCP Gracefully

If no generation MCP servers are available, Design Ops should:

1. Acknowledge that no generation tools are connected
2. Provide a complete, detailed specification that the user can use manually
3. Include the exact prompt they would use with each tool
4. Suggest which MCP server(s) to install for their use case
5. Offer to proceed with design guidance using Design Ops' other skills

### Step 4: Never Fail Silently

Always tell the user:

- Which MCP tool was selected and why
- What model is being used (for Fal.ai)
- What the generation will cost (approximate)
- What the expected output quality is
- How to iterate if the result is not satisfactory

## Multi-MCP Coordination

When multiple MCP servers are available, coordinate them for richer output:

### Screen + Assets Pipeline

1. Use Stitch to generate the screen layout
2. Use Recraft V3 (Fal.ai) to generate icons referenced in the screen
3. Use FLUX Pro or Imagen 4 (Fal.ai) to generate hero images
4. Use Figma MCP to export existing brand assets if available

### Design Extraction + Generation Pipeline

1. Use Figma MCP to extract design context from existing Figma files
2. Convert Figma styles into a design context object
3. Pass that context to Stitch for style-consistent screen generation
4. Score the generated screen against the Figma original

### Iterative Refinement Pipeline

1. Generate v1 with any tool
2. Score against the 10-dimension visual framework
3. Identify weakest dimensions
4. Adjust prompt to target weak dimensions
5. Regenerate v2
6. Repeat until quality gate is passed (max 3 iterations)
