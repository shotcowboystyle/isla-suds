# Business Design Templates — The Business Side of Design

## Mental model

These are the artifacts that leave the team. They are read by people who did not
attend the meeting, will not read the Figma, and are deciding whether to fund,
approve, or hire.

- **Lead with the decision you want.** A proposal that opens with your process
  makes the reader hunt for the ask. Put scope, timeline and price in the first
  screen.
- **Show the problem before the solution.** A case study that opens on the final
  UI reads as a portfolio piece. One that opens on the broken funnel reads as
  evidence.
- **Quantify or say you cannot.** "Improved usability" is noise. "Cut checkout
  abandonment from 71% to 54% over six weeks" is an argument. If you have no
  number, say what you observed instead of reaching for an adjective.
- **Scope is a fence, not a wish.** Every proposal names what is excluded. The
  excluded list prevents more disputes than the included one.

## Reference architecture

| File | Covers | Lines |
|---|---|---|
| `references/client-handoff-templates.md` | handoff and export | 1054 |

## What every reference file contains

1. The template as fill-in-the-blank prose, not a description of a template
2. A worked example with realistic numbers
3. What the reader is deciding, and what they need to decide it
4. The section people cut that they should not

## Routing

For **winning the work** — redesign, new-product, design-system, UX-audit and
ongoing-retainer proposals: read `references/proposal-templates.md`.

For **presenting** — design review decks and stakeholder decks for pitching a
direction: read `references/pitch-presentation-templates.md`.

For **telling the story afterwards** — the case study narrative structure plus
e-commerce and SaaS templates: read `references/case-study-templates.md`.

For **handing off to engineering** — Figma handoff practice, the developer
checklist, token export and asset export: read
`references/client-handoff-templates.md`.

For **documenting the system** — design spec format, component documentation and
interaction specification: read `references/design-documentation.md`.

For **odds and ends** — the patterns that had no home in the files above when this skill was converted to a router: read `references/business-supplementary.md`.
