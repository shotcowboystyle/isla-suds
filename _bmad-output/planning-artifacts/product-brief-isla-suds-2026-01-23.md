# Product Brief: isla-suds

## Executive Summary

Isla Suds is a premium artisanal goat milk soap brand offering four handcrafted bars made with organic ingredients and essential oils. Named after the founder's daughter and built on a family recipe passed down through generations, the brand embodies authenticity, local craftsmanship, and environmental responsibility.

This product brief defines a custom Shopify storefront that serves dual purposes: an immersive, sensory-rich e-commerce experience for individual consumers, and a streamlined wholesale portal for existing B2B relationships with local retailers. The goal is to create a digital presence that captures the tactile, aromatic essence of the products while freeing the founder from manual order management—enabling more time with family and community.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Selling artisanal soap online presents a fundamental challenge: the product experience is inherently sensory—texture, scent, and craftsmanship that customers can touch and smell at a farmers market but cannot experience through a screen. Generic e-commerce platforms fail to convey the authenticity and care behind handmade products, reducing them to commodity listings alongside mass-produced alternatives.

### Problem Impact

For the founder, manual order taking and inventory management via phone calls, texts, and paper records consumes time that could be spent with family and community. For customers, sterile product pages with generic descriptions fail to communicate what makes a handcrafted, organic, locally-made soap worth choosing. The result: lost sales, founder burnout, and a brand story that never gets told.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Competitor sites are generic big e-commerce platforms with hundreds of products, pushy sales tactics ("Buy Now!", "50% off if you order now!"), and no authentic voice. They prioritize conversion optimization over customer experience, treating artisanal products like commodities. Standard Shopify templates offer no way to convey:

- The family legacy behind a recipe passed down from mother to daughter
- The local, handmade nature of small-batch production
- The environmental consciousness of minimal packaging and local sourcing
- The sensory richness that makes each bar unique

### Proposed Solution

A custom Shopify Hydrogen storefront featuring:

- **Immersive Product Experience**: Interactive scrolling effects that let visitors virtually "feel" the texture of lavender buds, "smell" the brightness of lemongrass, and experience each bar's unique personality
- **Story-Driven Design**: The founder's story, Isla's namesake, and the family recipe woven throughout—not as marketing, but as authentic context
- **Dual-Purpose Architecture**: A polished B2C storefront for individual customers alongside a simple wholesale portal where existing retail partners can log in and reorder with minimal friction
- **Respect-First Commerce**: No pop-ups, no aggressive discounts, no interruptions—just a quality product presented with care

### Key Differentiators

| Isla Suds | Competitors |
|-----------|-------------|
| 4 focused products | Hundreds of SKUs |
| Family recipe, named after founder's daughter | Generic brand story |
| Handmade locally, organic ingredients | Mass-produced or unclear sourcing |
| Immersive, sensory-rich experience | Standard product grid layouts |
| First-class customer experience | Pushy sales tactics and pop-ups |
| Minimal packaging, low environmental footprint | Standard e-commerce packaging |

## Target Users

### Primary Users

#### Individual Consumers: "The Intentional Buyer"

**Persona: Sarah**
Sarah is a 34-year-old mother of two (ages 2 and 6) who has consciously opted out of mass-produced, corporate products. She's part of a growing movement of consumers who vote with their dollars—choosing local, organic, and handmade over convenient and cheap. She frequents farmers markets, values quality over quantity, and sees her purchasing decisions as an extension of her values.

**How She Discovers Isla Suds:**
Sarah spots the vibrant, uncut soap bricks from across the farmers market. The rich purple of the lavender mint and bright yellow of the lemongrass catch her eye. She approaches, curious about the visible texture—the lavender buds, mint leaves, and sea salt crystals embedded in the bars. The visual stops her; the story keeps her.

**What She Values:**
- Organic, locally-made products that align with her anti-corporate stance
- Supporting small businesses and local artisans
- Variety and sensory experience—each scent is a different mood
- The story behind the product: family recipe, named after a daughter, minimal packaging
- Quality that she can see and feel

**Buying Behavior:**
- Purchases 2-3 bars every other week
- Rotates through all four scents—variety seeker, not a single-scent loyalist
- Buys for herself and for bathing her children
- High loyalty—seeks out the booth at each market
- Word-of-mouth advocate who shares the story, not just the product

**Emotional Driver:**
Sarah isn't just buying soap. She's opting out of corporate and opting into something better. When she finds Isla Suds, she's found her people—a brand that believes what she believes.

**Success Moment:**
The first shower with the soap. The lather is creamy, the scent fills the bathroom, and her skin feels genuinely different afterward. But the deeper success? Knowing she supported a local mom, a family recipe, and a product made with care—not a factory line.

#### Wholesale Partners: "The Local Curator"

**Persona: Jim**
Jim owns a 50-year-old general store serving a rural community. His store's identity is built on locally-made and fresh products—he knows his suppliers by name. He doesn't just stock products; he curates an experience that reflects his community's values. Carrying Isla Suds isn't a business decision; it's an extension of what his store stands for.

**Persona: Maria**
Maria manages purchasing for a local convenience store franchise with four neighborhood locations. She differentiates her shops from big-box competitors by stocking local, quality products. She's proud to tell customers where the soap comes from.

**What They Value:**
- Supporting local businesses and artisans
- Products that sell themselves through quality
- Simple, no-friction reorder process
- Being the exclusive local source for a unique product

**Current Workflow:**
- Track inventory visually (small-scale operations)
- Contact founder when supply runs low
- Reorder on a regular cadence

**Portal Needs (Keep It Simple):**
- Login and see order history
- "Reorder Last Order" button—2 clicks maximum
- View pricing and past invoices
- No complexity—Shopify B2B handles this natively

**Success Moment:**
A customer asks "do you have more of that goat milk soap?" and they can say yes—because reordering took 30 seconds.

- Email capture and basic marketing automation
- Customer reviews and testimonials
- Expanded bundle options
- Seasonal or limited-edition scents

**Medium-Term (Year 2):**
- Subscription model for regular customers
- Expanded wholesale network beyond local
- Gift cards and gifting features
- Blog with soap-making stories, ingredient spotlights

**Long-Term Vision:**
- National brand recognition in artisanal soap space
- Potential retail partnerships beyond local stores
- Product line expansion (lotions, bath bombs, etc.)
- The "booth experience" becomes the benchmark for artisanal e-commerce

**The North Star:** Isla Suds becomes the example of how a local, handmade brand can create a digital experience that rivals—and exceeds—the in-person connection.
